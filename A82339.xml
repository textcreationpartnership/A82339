         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>I</hi> Am very ſenſible that Diſcourſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion in this Age are much ſlighted and derided by ſome kind of men that make high pretences to Learning and Know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge, who tell us that this talk of Converſion is fitter for <hi>Pagans</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> to hear than <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> But as ſome peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſpeak againſt Learning that have none them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſo ſuch Perſons may be thought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh againſt Converſion, and the Spirit of God, becauſe they never experienced the effects of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them in themſelves; For certainly,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>I.</hi> It is not the taking on us the Profeſsion of Chriſtianity that can ſave our Souls, or make us happy forever. If to ceaſe to be <hi>Jews</hi> or <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans</hi> and to put on the Chriſtian Profeſsion were ſufficient, then the Chriſtians of <hi>Sardis</hi> and <hi>Laodicea,</hi> who had a name to live, would never have been condemned by our bleſſed Lord, and threatned to be ſpewed out, <hi>Rev. 3.1, 16.</hi> Are there not many thae name the name of Jeſus Chriſt, that yet depart not from Iniquity, and
<pb facs="tcp:153892:3"/> profeſs they know God, but in works deny him, and will God receive theſe for True Converts, becauſe they are turned to the Chriſtian Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>II.</hi> It is not being Baptized into the Chriſtian Faith, nor being Waſhed in the Laver of Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that can denominate a Man a real and ſincere Chriſtian. Many take the Preſs Money and wear the Livery of Chriſt, that yet never ſtand to their Colours nor follow their Leader; <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus</hi> were baptized as well as the reſt; How fondly then do many men miſtake, deceiving and being deceived, dreaming that the effectual Grace of God is neceſſarily joyned to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adminiſtration of Baptiſm, and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Converted and Regenerated already when Baptized, they need no more: But if this were ſo, then all that were baptized in their Infancy muſt neceſſarily be ſaved, becauſe the promiſe of Pardon and Salvation is made to Converſion and Regeneration, and we need look no further to ſee our Names written in Heaven, but to ſearch the Regiſter and ſee whether we were baptized, and the Certificate of our Baptiſm will be the faireſt evidence for Heaven, and we need only to cry God mercy and be abſolved by the Miniſter at our Death, and we ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God. But let me tell you from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, that whatever benefits you receive by
<pb facs="tcp:153892:3"/> baptiſm, yet if when you come to years you be unholy, unclean, malicious, covetous, a ſcoffer, or the like, you cannot be ſaved except you be renewed again by repentance and a through and powerful change of your heart and life.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>III.</hi> It is not Moral Righteouſneſs that will evidence us to be Chriſtians; we muſt exceed the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees;</hi> And though the bleſſed Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> before his Converſion ſays, that he <hi>was touching the Righteouſneſs of the Law blameleſs,</hi> Phil. <hi>3.</hi> So that none could charge him with the leaſt immorality, and though the ſelf juſtifying <hi>Phariſee</hi> could ſay <hi>I am no Extortioner, Adulterer, Unjuſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Luke 18.11.</hi> yet this was not ſufficient; Thou muſt have ſomething more than all this to ſhew, or elſe God will not juſtifie thee. I condemn not Morality, but we are not to reſt there. Piety in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes Morality, as Chriſtianity doth Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and Grace includes Reaſon, but we muſt not divide the two Tables.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <hi>IV.</hi> External Conformity to the Rules of Piety is not enough to make us true Chriſtians; Many have <hi>a Form of Godlineſs</hi> without the Power; they may pray long, faſt often, hear gladly, and be very forward in the ſervice of God, though coſtly and expenſive, and yet be ſtrangers to Chriſtianity, and the divine Life; It will not be enough for them to plead at the great Day of Account that the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb facs="tcp:153892:4"/> kept their Church, ſaid their Prayers, received the Sacrament conſtantly, gave Alms, or the like; For there is no outward ſervice but an Hypocrite may perform it, even to the giving all <hi>his goods to the poor and his body to be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, 1</hi> Cor. <hi>13.3.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>V.</hi> A Seeming Conformity to the will of God, occaſioned either by the reſtraint of humane Laws, Education, Afflictions or the like, can never give us aſſurance of eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs; 'Tis too common and eaſy, to miſtake E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation for the Grace of God, but if this were true, who was a better man than <hi>Jehoaſh,</hi> who while his <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncle lived was very forward in Gods ſervice, and calls upon him to repair the houſe of the Lord, <hi>2 Kings 12.2, 7.</hi> yet there was nothing but good Education all this while, for when his good Tutor was taken out of the way, he appears to have been only chained up, and preſently falls to Idolatry; ſo in caſe of humane Laws, and Afflictions, though men may ſeem very conformable while they are reſtrained by them, yet that being removed many throw of all, and commit iniquity with groedineſs.</p>
            <p>Having briefly declared what true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity is not, I ſhall in ſhort diſcover what it is; <hi>Converſion or true Religion conſiſts in the thro' change both of the heart and life, by the Spirit of God, through the merits and Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> Where this is in truth,
<pb facs="tcp:153892:4"/> it goes throughout all the powers, principles and practices of a man; His mind is changed, and the ſcales of his natural ignorance fall off, ſo that God and his glory weigh down all carnal and worldly Intereſts, and he is turned from darkneſs to light. He that thought formerly there was little hurt in ſin, now comes to ſee it to be the chief of evils; Heretofore he ſaw no form nor comelineſs in his holy Redeemer that he ſhould deſire him, but now he finds him to be the hid Treaſure, and the Pearl of price, for which he is willing to part with all, to purchaſe it. Now God is all to him, and he values his favour and the light of his countenance above all the good that he formerly inquired after, and ſet his heart upon. Let the world now preſent her ſelf in all the glory of her Kingdoms, yet his Soul will prefer a naked, a crucified, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted Chriſt before her, and he will cry out, <hi>The Lord is my portion ſaith my ſoul: Whom have I in Heaven but thee, and there is none upon Earth that I deſire beſides thee; God is the ſtrength of my heart and my por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He had rather be gracious than great, and had rather be the holieſt man upon Earth, than the moſt learned the moſt famous or the moſt proſperous.</p>
            <p>His Joys are changed, he now rejoyceth in the ways of Gods Teſtimonies more than in all
<pb facs="tcp:153892:5"/> Riches; He delights in the Law of the Lord, of which he formerly had little Savour; He hath no ſuch joy as in the thoughts of Chriſt and fruition of his company forever.</p>
            <p>His cares and fears are altered, he was once careful about the things of this life, but now his great ſolicitude is how to ſecure his Soul, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting concerns; He uſed to fear nothing ſo much as the loſs of his Eſtate, Reputation, Friends, or Pleaſures. Nothing ſounded ſo terrible to him as pain, poverty or diſgrace; Now theſe are little to him in compariſon with the diſhonour and diſpleaſure of God; It pierces his heart to think of loſing Gods favour or of being parted from his bleſſed Saviour.</p>
            <p>His love runs a new courſe and he (like the ancient Father) can ſcarce find words ſweet e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to expreſs his affections to his well beloved Jeſus, <q>Let me ſee thee O Light of mine eyes; Come O thou joy of my Spirit. Let me behold thee O the gladneſs of my heart; Let me love thee O Light of my Soul; Appear unto me O my ahief delight, my ſweet Comforter; O my God, my Life, &amp; the whole glory of my Soul, Let me find thee, O Deſire of my heart; Let me hold thee O Love of my Soul; Let me im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace thee, and poſſeſs thee O heavenly Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>His Sorrows have now a Vent by the veiw of his Sins the ſight of a Crucified Chriſt which
<pb facs="tcp:153892:5"/> did ſcarce move him before<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> how much doth it affect his heart; His hatred boils, his anger burns agatnſt ſin, all the faculties and members of his Soul and Body that were formerly inſtruments of ſin are now become the holy <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>tenſils of Chriſts living Temple.</p>
            <p>That eye which was once wandring, wanton, haughty, and covetous, is now imployed (as <hi>Marys</hi>) weeping over his ſins, in beholding God in his works, in reading his word, in ſearching for Objects of Charity and Mercy, and ſeeking all opportunities to do him ſervsce.</p>
            <p>That ear that was opened to <hi>Satan</hi>'s call, and like a vitiated appetite, reliſhed nothing better than filthy or at leaſt ſrothy unprofitable diſcourſe and the laughter of Fools, is now boar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear the ſweet voice of Jeſus, and is open to his Teachings; it now ſays, Speak Lord, for thy Servant heareth, and waits for his word as the rain, which is ſweeter to him than the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and the honey comb, or his appointed food.</p>
            <p>That head which was filled with carnal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances and deſigns, is now imployed in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of greater concern, and ſtudies how it may perform the will of God; His thoughts are now more intent about his duty than his gain, and his principal buſineſs is how he may pleaſe God and avoid Sin.</p>
            <p>His heart which was full of pollution and defilement, is now become an Altar of divine
<pb facs="tcp:153892:6"/> Incenſe, where the fire of Celeſtial Love is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually burning, and from whence the dayly Sacrifice of Prayer and Praiſe, and the ſweet perfume of holy Deſires, Ejaculations and Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquies are conſtantly aſcending.</p>
            <p>His mouth is become a well ſpring of Life, his tongue is as choice Silver, &amp; his lips feed many; Now the Salt of heavenly Grace hath ſeaſoned his ſpeech and purged out all its corruption; Hath cleanſed it from its former filthy tommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, flatery, boaſting, railing, lying, ſwearing, backbiting, which once iſſued out like flaſhes of infernal fire, from the Hell that was in his heart.</p>
            <p>His throat that was once an open Sepulchre, now ſends forth the ſweet breath of Prayer and holy Diſcourſe, and the man ſpeaks in another Tongue, even the language of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and is never ſo well pleaſed as when talking of God Chriſt, and the glorious things of another world His mouth bringeth forth Wiſdom, and his tongue is become the Silver Trumpet of his Makers Praiſe and Glory.</p>
            <p>To conlude, his Converſation is in Heaven, and the New Man takes a new courſe, in his life and practice; when God hath given him the new heart, and writ his Law in his mind, he forthwith walks in his Statutes, and keeps his Judgments, and though ſin, like a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and unwelcome gueſt God knows, dwells in him, yet it hath no more dominion over him;
<pb facs="tcp:153892:6"/> He hath his fruit unto holineſs, and though he hath many a fall, yet the Law and Life of Jeſus is his Rule, and he hath an unfeigned reſpect to all Gods Commandments, and keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth a good conſcience willing in all things to live honeſtly and without offence towards God and Men.</p>
            <p>In ſuch a ſtate as this no doubt, were thoſe eminent Chriſtians who made the following ſolemn Declarations, of the gracious Experiences which they had of the exceeding love &amp; favour of God to their Souls in ſupporting them under their doubts and difficulties, and afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming their minds in the good ways of the Lord. They had found the Lord to be merciful and full of goodneſs, compaſſion and truth, and therefore thought that they ought with their mouths to ſhew forth his Praiſe, both to ſtir up thers to joyn with them therein, and likewiſe to incourage poor, diſtreſſed, diſconſolate Chriſtians to put their truſt in the Almighty, ſince if they perſevere ſincerely in ſeeking his face he will certainly at length diſcover himſelf unto them and fill their hearts with joy and gladneſs.</p>
            <p>And it maybe reaſonably hoped that theſe heavenly Experiences will be very effectual and conducive thereunto, ſince they confiſt of ſuch variety of Tryals, Temptations and Exerciſes of Spirit, that we can ſcarce ſuppoſe but the moſt diſquieted deſpairing Soul may here meet with
<pb facs="tcp:153892:7"/> Caſes as dark and comfortleſs as his own, and and likewiſe find what a good end the Lord in his due time brought all the troubles of his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Children unto; And for this purpoſe no doubt they were firſt Collected and Publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome years ſince by divers Faithful and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſters of the Goſpel, in and about <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> and though they have omitted the Names of the Perſons becauſe no glorying ſhould appear therein, yet they were then known to be Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans who had truly taſted &amp; ſeen that the Lord was gracious; Now that the God of all Peace and Conſolation may give his bleſſing hereunto is the hearty and earneſt Prayer and deſire of him who is, A wellwiſher to the Souls of Men.</p>

               <p>BEfore I give an account of my own Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, I ſhall briefly diſcover the Duty, and uſefulneſs of communicating Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Experiences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is a Duty, becauſe it hath been the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of the People of God in former Ages: When our bleſſed Saviour had cleanſed the Leper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 8.4. he bid him, Go, and ſhew it for a Teſtimony; and <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.7. the Angels by <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> Go quickly and tell the Diſciples that Chriſt whom they ſought was riſen; and <hi>verſe</hi> 10. Chriſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the two <hi>Marys,</hi> renews the Precept, <hi>Go tell my Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. For now ye know it, and have ſeen me, and can aſſuredly ſay that I am riſen. And in <hi>Joel</hi> 1.3. <hi>Tell your Children, and let your Children tell their Children, and their Children another Generation.</hi> And this is obſerved by the Jews at this day out of <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.7. And to add more So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity to the commemoration of God's Law, and their deliverance from <hi>Egypt,</hi> they write it down in a piece of Parchment, and then rolling it up ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcribe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:153892:8"/> it, <hi>To the Lord,</hi> and faſten it to the Wall, or the Poſt of the Door on the right hand of the Entrance, and as often as they go in and out they touch, and kiſs it with great affection and devotion: This alſo is commanded, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.8. <hi>Come taſte and ſee that the Lord is good;</hi> and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Comfort your ſelves together, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie one another, even as alſo ye do.</hi> And what is more excellent for edification and conſolation, than to tell what God hath done for our Souls; whereby many who have met with the like, may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed and comforted. <hi>David</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16, crys out, <hi>I will tell of all thy wondrous works;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 66.19. <hi>Come and hear</hi> (ſays he) <hi>all ye that ſear the Lord, and I will declare what he hath done for my Soul;</hi> and <hi>verſe</hi> 19. <hi>Verily God hath heard me, and hath not turned away his mercy from me.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.30. <hi>The way of God is perfect</hi> (ſaith <hi>David.</hi>) How know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou this, <hi>David?</hi> Oh! ſays he, <hi>I have tryed it; The Word of the Lord is tryed;</hi> I can tell it by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, and I know that <hi>he is a Buckler to all that truſt in him.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. He promiſes, that as ſoon as his broken bones were healed, and the joy of his Salvation was reſtored to him, he would preſently preach it, and <hi>teach tranſgreſſors God's ways, and ſinners ſhould be converted unto him:</hi> He would give ſinners warning of ſin, and uncleanneſs, and tell them what it was to lie in helliſh horrours, to have a wounded Spirit, an accuſing Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the Indignaton of an angry frowning God. Thus alſo the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. <hi>Knowing the terrour of the Lord, we perſwade men:</hi> We tell them the ſad condition they are in, now we are delivered out of it, on purpoſe to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſw<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de them to believe in God, to get out of their carnal ſtate, and to taſt and ſee the mercy, grace, and love of God in Chriſt in the Goſpel, and as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:153892:8"/> the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.3. <hi>If ſo be ye have taſted how gracious the Lord is:</hi> O then you will ſay, It is good, it is ſweet, and will incourage others to come and be made partakers thereof.</p>
               <p n="2">2. As this is a Duty, and hath been the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Primitive Times, ſo it is very uſeful and neceſſary for ſeveral Reaſons. 1. It is a bearing the beſt outward Teſtimony to God and his Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes that can be, when we can ſay by experience that God is gracious, loving, ſlow to anger, ready to forgive, that he is true and faithful, for we have tryed him, and therefore know it; and the want of this makes us ſo often queſtion his care, truth, mercy and love to us in times of Tryal. 2. It is neceſſary to communicate Experiences, thereby to diſcover thoſe that are ſound Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians and ſincere Believers, as far as may be judged by outward appearance, converſation, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication. 3. It may be uſeful to prevent us from cenſuring, or having hard thoughts of thoſe who are under ſpiritual Agonies, Afflictions and Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; all which our bleſſed Redeemer himſelf <hi>ſuffered, that he might be able to ſuccour them that are tempted,</hi> Heb. 2.18. So that when we ſee poor Souls ſet on the wrack, and roaring under tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and crying out, Oh! they are damned, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, forſaken of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet we ought not to condemn them, for even then they may be the dear Children of God, and may paſs a wrong Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon themſelves, ſo long as they lie in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and under the ſenſe of their own ruinous condition, till they find help and ſalvation in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; of which you may find divers Inſtances in the following Experiences. 4. By theſe Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences we may learn how various the Lord is in his ways and workings; as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1. <hi>God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners ſpake
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153892:9"/> to the Fathers by the Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. To ſome he comes in one way, like a Lion, and to ſome in another, like a Lamb; to ſome by ſickneſs, to others by croſſes and loſſes; to ſome by Sermons, and to others by Reading the Scriptures, Chriſtian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe and the like. Again, to ſome the Lord diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers himſelf in an extraordinary way, as in Dream, Trance, Voice or Viſion; but neither theſe, nor the ordinary manifeſtations of God's Love are to be regarded, unleſs they are confirmed by the Scriptures, and the Promiſes therein; and unleſs they alſo make the perſon more holy, humble, and mean in his own Eyes, and more to admire the Free Grace of God to him a poor un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſinner; and the Lord knows what means is moſt proper, for that which will work upon one man, may have no operation upon another. 5. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences do oblige and allure Chriſtians exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, to rely upon God, and to believe in him. For, as <hi>David</hi> ſays, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.1, 2. <hi>I cry, I roar night and day for deliverance;</hi> but what Argument doth he uſe? ſee <hi>verſe</hi> 4, 5. <hi>Our Fathers truſted in thee, they truſted, and thou didſt deliver them; they cryed unto thee, and were delivered; they truſted in thee, and were not confounded.</hi> Therefore deliver me too, for I truſt in thee. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.24. <hi>Be of good cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the Lord;</hi> even as he hath ſtrengthened my heart, and heard my voice and crys (as in the verſes before) ſo he will yours, O all ye Saints! Thus the Woman of <hi>Samaria, John</hi> 4.28, 29. ran into the City, and declared her Experiences of the Meſſiah that was come, and how he told her all things, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And obſerve how this weak means wrought upon many; for, <hi>verſe</hi> 29. it is ſaid, <hi>That many of the Samaritans believed in him, becauſe of the ſaying of the poor Woman.</hi> And thus <hi>Junius</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153892:9"/> that the very firſt thing which converted him him from Atheiſm, and made him believe in God, was a Conference with a poor Country-man near <hi>Florence</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are many other benefits that ariſe from Chriſtians communicating their Experiences of the favour, love, and goodneſs of God towards them; ſome being informed, others confuted, others com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and confirmed in the good ways of the Lord; ſo that it is to be wiſht, that this Chriſtian duty were more practiſed, whereby others might be incouraged to truſt in God, by hearing what he hath done for our Souls. I ſhall add no more, but proceed to give an account of the wonderful dealings of the Almighty with my unworthy ſelf.</p>
               <p>TO give a formal Account of my Life would be tedious, though I may ſafely ſay, in every year ſinee I can remember; I have been inricht with ſo many and ſuch remarkable Experiences, as may make ſome rather admire than believe them: And firſt, when I was a School-Boy at <hi>Malden</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> I began to be rouzed by two Men, Mr. <hi>Will. Fenner,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Stephen Marſhall,</hi> about the tenth year of my Age; for before that, I was I know not what, though I was kept to read every day, was Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed, with other good Orders: But then hearing Mr. <hi>Fenner</hi> full of Zeal, and ſeeing him thundering about, and beating the Pulpit, I was amazed, and thought he was mad, wondring what he meant: Now whilſt I was gazing upon him, I was ſuddenly ſtruck, and perceived it was we that were mad, which made him ſeem to be ſo: Oh! ſays he, <q>You knotty, rugged, proud pieces of fleſh, you ſtony, rocky, flinty, hard hearts, what will you do when you are roaring in Hell among the damned, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
                  </q> This made me at firſt aſtoniſht, and run ſo often
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153892:10"/> in my mind afterward, that I began to be troubled, ſcared, and affrighted, and for fear of going to Hell, I fell to praying, hearing Sermons, reading the Scriptures morning and evening, though I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood little, but only thought the bare reading ſufficient: I learnt to pray firſt out of Books, and got all the Graces, ſo called, by heart; and after Family-Prayers, I was every night afraid the Devil would carry me away to Hell, if I did not ſay my prayers, <hi>Our Father,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>I believe in God,</hi> &amp;c. with the Ten Commandments and my little Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſm of Dr. <hi>Hall</hi>'s, which I had learnt: And this I did duly every night before I durſt ſleep, which I thought a ſufficient defence to preſerve me from the Devil's tearing me in pieces before morning. Yet ſometimes when I was ſleepy, to make more haſte, I would ſay ſome of them in the Chimney-corner whilſt I was undreſſing me; thinking all was well enough, ſo it were but done: Yea, when I was extreamly ſurprized with fear of the Devil, being apt to fancy any thing to be him, I often ſaid all my Prayers and Commandments twice over, ſuſpecting I had not ſaid them well enough, or had for haſte left out ſome of them, and the like; and thus as the Apoſtle ſays, <hi>When I was a Child, I did childiſh things,</hi> and thought all this was very well; and oft-times I would get one of my Play-fellows to walk alone with me, and would tell him of Sin and Hell, and ſuch matters, for they ran al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in my mind, and I was in a deſperate fear.</p>
               <p>At length going to hear Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> whilſt I was nodding, and almoſt aſleep, his powerful voice awakened me, thundring in my Ears the dreadful danger of ſuch as were drowſie, and ſlept, and ſlumbred away their Salvation, which I thought was ſpoken directly to me, and had ſuch preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency upon me, that I ſtarted up with an aking
<pb facs="tcp:153892:10"/> heart, being much terrified at his words, which he ſtill purſued, and wounded me to the heart, when he told us; <q>That when time was paſt, it could never be recalled again, and that there was no other way but to double our diligence, and redeem the time we had loſt by making more haſte, and taking more care and pains, or elſe we ſhould be ut<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erly loſt and undone:</q> This touched me ſufficiently, ſo that I could not forbear weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing extreamly: After Sermon I went home, and ſitting alone, I fell to crying and complaining that I had loſt my time, taking up a reſolution never to ſleep at Church again, and I think I have kept that ſolemn Covenant to this very day.</p>
               <p>After this, I was not content with my former cuſtomary duties, for now I muſt double them, and do more than before; wherefore I reſolved to write down the Sermons I heard, as well as I could, but having little skill to write faſt or orderly, I ever obſerved the Doctrines, Reaſons and Heads of the Uſes, which I got by heart, repeating the morning Sermon at noon, and the evening Sermon at night, ſo that I could the readilier anſwer my Father when he examined me; and then I learnt out of a Book a prayer for morning, and another for evening: This courſe I continued for nine or ten years together, ſo that at length I attained to repeat to my ſelf the ſubſtance of ſome Sermons which I had heard ſeven or eight years before; and the Lord led me on in this orderly way (I know not how) without the advice or direction of any perſon upon Earth, whereby I hoped to work out my Salvation, and redeem my time. But this I muſt ſay, from this Form I learnt much of God and Goodneſs; and what I did at firſt for fear of Hell, at laſt I performed out of love to Heaven, yea out of love to God and Chriſt, as if it were without
<pb facs="tcp:153892:11"/> 
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eaven. I uſed this method ſome years after I came to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridg</hi> whereby I was enabled to Recollect ſeveral Mens Sermons 10 years after they were Preached, and likewiſe with Gods aſſiſtance to Preach my ſelf, at 18. or 19. years of age, to the great wonder of many.</p>
               <p>Thus you hear how formal I was, and I muſt needs confeſs it was more out of fear than love that I maintain'd this ſtrictneſs in the duties of Religion; But not long after I was further awakened by my own Father Mr. <hi>N. R.</hi> Miniſter in <hi>Eſſex</hi> who preaching upon the Good <hi>Samaritan,</hi> and ſhewing Chriſts Compaſſion to wounded Souls he in reproof of Sinners declared, <q>That they were more guilty than the hardhearted <hi>Jews,</hi> that they Crucifie Chriſt afreſh, and have no Compaſſion on him now he is in Glory, but Spit on him and make him Suffer, and that his blood would riſe up in Judgment againſt them, for if <hi>Abels</hi> a meer mans did ſo, much more his, and if <hi>David</hi> prayed to be delivered from blood guiltineſs, how ought we to beg of God to be freed from being guilty of the precious blood of the Son of God and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World.</q> This he Preached and preſſed ſo powerfully, that I was thrown into a trembling, as lying under the guilt of Chriſts blood, and was long perplext with the horror thereof.</p>
               <p>One Remarkable Paſſage I muſt never forget which happened in my Youth, that being one time playing and running about my Father's houſe, with my other Companions, I know not upon what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I uttered vain words, crying, O Lord, which we were not ſuffered to do, whereupon my heart was inſtantly ſmitten and I was ſuddenly ſet a running by I know not what Power or Spirit, as if I had been poſſeſt, and could not poſſibly ſtay my ſelf till I was carried with much violence to a little gate
<pb facs="tcp:153892:11"/> way, where to my apprehenſion I perceived, as plainly as ere I ſaw any thing by the Sun-ſhine, a naked Sword glittering with a ſharp edge, which took up the whole ſpace of the Gate from one Poſt to the other with a broad blade moſt keen and cruel; at which ſad ſight, being almoſt diſtracted With fear, I ſhriekt out, yet had not the leaſt power to ſtop, but was forcibly carried toward it, ſo that the edge of the threatning blade meeting with my Body, it ſeemed to me impoſſible that I ſhould eſcape death, and I made no other account but to be quite off, and parted aſunder; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards being hurried through with that irreſiſtible force, I had ſtrength to ſtay a little beyond it, and to contemplate the deſperate peril that I was in; I ſtood as one amazed, and ſcarce knew whether I were alive or dead, yea I could hardly believe my ſelf to be any thing but a dead man, or at leaſt mortally and deadly wounded, if not wofully and deplorably cut in twain: Oh! how I ſtood trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling and turmoiled in my thoughts, until after ſome time the Vital blood which was retired for the hearts defence, began to diſperſe and circulate in its former courſe, and then I lookt about, and turned to the gate way, but the appearance was paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed away, the Sword gone and vaniſht, whilſt I was left alone (the reſt running away) in a Labarynth of fears, griefs, and doubts, free from an wound with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, but deeply and wofully wounded within, and never ſince to the praiſe of Gods grace as I know of, have I made ſuch vain and irreverent mention of the name of the Lord. But good God! what was thy will herein? Thou who art not tyed to means or order, beſt ordereſt and diſpoſeſt of all things for thine own deſign and glory! and ſo this was I am ſure, but what it was I know not; yet it left a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing impreſſion upon me, and, the Scar is ſtill to be
<pb facs="tcp:153892:12"/> be ſeen in my heart, though the wound be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
               <p>But alas! how long and lamentably did I lye afflicted, and in continual fears after this? Every Thunder and Lightning I lookt upon as fatal to me, and ſent to deſtroy me, and then I would fall to my prayers, and ſaying my Creed and Commandments, and to my Sermons as faſt as I could, that I might be found well doing at leaſt, if not as a Charm to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me, or a challeng to God by virtue of them to keep and defend me; And I remember it was a great comfort to me to conſider that others did not do as I did, but that they altogether flighted ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, prayer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and lived wickedly and carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in drunkeneſs, diſobedience, Sabbath-breaking, and other ſins every day; this I was ſo far from grieving at and weeping over, that I, in my heart, rejoyced in it, as having more hopes, and fancying my ſelf to be in a better condition than they, and therefore ſhould have more favour from the hand of God; but all this while, (like an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> in <hi>Aegypt</hi>) I work't for life, and my Services were my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, and I would often take occaſion to diſcourſe with my Brothers, Siſters, and School-fellows, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Heaven and Hell, and what a hard thing it was to be ſaved.</p>
               <p>Being at <hi>Malden</hi> in <hi>Eſſex</hi> ſome time after, I had a certain Dream which ſeemed afterward fulfied; It was about the time when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> had a Sea fight in the <hi>Downs,</hi> which I hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſome talk of, it filled me with fears, and the following night I dreamed that I ſaw fire rained, or rather powred down round about, and looking where I was, I thought my ſelf to be without the Coach yard Gate of my Fathers houſe; I was much affrighted to ſee nothing but fire on every ſide of me, and looking upward and about me, praying
<pb facs="tcp:153892:12"/> earneſtly for Deliverance, none came nigh me by a good ſpace, though flaming in all places elſe, ſo that I could ſee none exempted; wherefore being afflicted for my Father and our Family, I fell on my knees, to ask mercy for them, and continued praying a long while before I could be heard; but at laſt, I thought I was bid to ariſe and look, and then the Fire ſeemed not to fall ſo faſt on my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Houſe as before, but abated by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, till I awaked. Now though this Dream ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much upon my Spirits for the preſent; yet I accounted it only a fancy, till about ſix years after meeting with Dr. <hi>Draiton</hi> in the Iſle of <hi>Ely,</hi> and repeating it to him, he declared to me, that for ſeveral Reaſons which he gave, this muſt be more than a meer Dream or working of fancy, and that ſomething would happen which this did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignifie, inſtancing in ſome of the like kind which himſelf, his Wife, and others had met with, as warnings and predictions; and therefore he wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me by no means to ſlight or contemn it, becauſe he was confident it did preſage ſome fiery and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry Diſpenſation upon our Family, and that my Father and the reſt, would fall under ſome trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the times or otherwiſe, and my ſelf ſhould be free, and at liberty to pray for them; and that by degrees, they ſhould be brought out, and the Fire abated; this interpretation which he gave more fully, was for the moſt part verified ſome years after.</p>
               <p>But all this while I was labouring for Heaven, in an exceeding formal way, and did much covet to know the things of God, and therefore often wiſht that I were a Miniſter, ſuch a one as Mr. <hi>Fenner,</hi> Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> my Father, or ſome other Eminent Preacher, that ſo I might attain to their Knowledge, and then I thought I ſhould do

               <p>To theſe inward Tortures, I had the addition of many ſore outward Afflictions, which much height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned my Sorrows, being often (doubtleſs I might deſerve it too to much) beaten, bruiſed, turned out of Doors, kickt about, and moſt ſeverely and unkindly uſed. At which times I ſhould be Tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Murther my ſelf; and ſometimes to think I could not belong to God; for if I did, he would not endure to ſee me thus uſed and Afflicted, who did always fly to him, and prayed, and prayed, and prayed, but I had as good ſpeak to a poſt, for I was not Relieved; other times I ſhould read and weep, and (as my uſual manner was, in the time of my great Deſpair) would fall flat all along, with my face on the ground, and cry, and ſigh and weep, and call for help, but the Lord's time was not yet come to anſwer; I often wept half, and ſometimes a whole Night together, watering my Bed with my Tears, for fear of Hell and the Devil, becauſe of my Sins, and Rebellious Diſobedience; I always Slept with my Hands claſped together, that ſo if I ſhould dye, or that the Devils ſhould prey upon me, I might be found in a praying po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, ſleeping as well as waking; and for five or ſix years together, I never durſt go to ſleep in any other manner.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="tcp:153892:17"/> was a God, that this God was Righteous, and that he would hear my Prayers, if I continued calling upon him, and crying to him with Importunity without ceaſing; ſeeing the unjuſt Judge that we read of in Scripture, was prevailed upon by the Importunities of the poor Widdow;</p>
               <p>Hereupon having gathered together thoſe ſcatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Relicks of Reaſon that were left me, I took up a Reſolution, that I would continue in Prayer, and ſo I did, though by fits I was froward, and mute, and mild, and I know not how, ſometimes ſcarce eating a bit of Bread in five days together; after which I was in another form and frame of ſpirit, (though by turns, full of Diſtraction and Deſperate thoughts) I grew more Serious, and began to weigh things, as in a Ballance, and to Expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late with the Lord, and to Pray by fits moſt furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and now and then the Tears which were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dryed up, began to Trickle and Rowl down my Face, like ſwollen drops of Blood:</p>
               <p>Thus I continued three or four days, till one Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon coming into the Chamber, my Heart being as big and full as it could hold, I threw my ſelf flat on my face as uſually, ſtriking on the Boards, and crying to the Lord for Deliverance, and uſing ſuch extravagant Expreſſions as might diſcover that I was in Deſpair; then ſtanding up, I walked a turn or two ſaying, is there not a God? Is he Gracious? Are the Scriptures falſe? <q>Canſt thou take delight to ſee a poor Soul thus ſet on the Rack, Sighing and Roaring in Torment? Riſe up and appear for thy ſelf, thou Great God, ſhew thy ſelf Gracious in one Act of Mercy, in deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pight of all the Devils in Hell;</q> Then beating my Breaſt, and tearing my Hair, I threw my ſelf on the Bed, whilſt my Eyes were glazed and brim full with Tears; There I lay till a ſuddain ſleep
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:153892:18"/> ſeized upon me, and I dreamed of the ſame Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that had been a killing Letter to me, which now through the Spirit of Chriſt quickned me, whereby I was made ſenſible that Chriſts Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs being by Faith, made mine, did exceed the Righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, and that except I, in and by the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt made mine, did excell their Righteouſneſs, I could not be Saved. When I awaked, I was ſo much changed, that I was amazed at my ſelf, at the ſuddenneſs of it; for I dreamt I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and that my Heart was filled with Joy, and when I awaked, it was ſo indeed; I ſtarted up, and rebuked my ſelf ſaying, why am not I damned? VVhat's the matter? VVhy am I ſo filled with a fancy, and with a ſuddain hope of I know not what, nor whence; I then fell to pray, and whilſt I was praying, I ſaid, Lord is this true? Say Lord is it true? If it be ſo, diſcover it to me, confirm me in it; at length I was perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt was mine, that this Garment was provided for ſuch poor, naked, torn Creatures as I was; whereupon I took the Bible, and found ſeveral Scriptures which ſeemed to confirm the ſame to me, and I was fflled with Divine infuſions, and immediate Reſolutions agreeable to the will of God given out there; and then I began to breath upon it, and pauſe a little, and by degrees to revive and look up with ſome hope, till the Lord ſatisfied me by revealing to my Heart, that Chriſt's Righteouſneſs was my only Juſtification, and that therein I did exceed all Phariſaical Righteouſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whereby I had comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hopes of Salvation, in and through Jeſus Chriſt, from that very ſame Scripture, which did before condemn me.</p>
               <p>After this I began plainly to perceive, why my
<pb facs="tcp:153892:18"/> my ſelf and ſo many others were ſo long and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentably loſt in Deſpair, that it was becauſe we ſought for Juſtification in a wrong place, and were therefore in the wrong way to Salvation; juſt as if a Man ſhould dig in his Garden for a Mine of Gold; no wonder that we loſe our labour at laſt, after Sweating, Tears, Prayers, Cares, Pains, Fears and all, ſeeing we look in a wrong place. Thus was it with me, all the while I was looking and poaring, and perplexing my ſelf for a Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my own, and to ſeek in my ſelf to exceed the Scribes and Phariſees, Alas! I was loſt, undone, and could not find it, nor ſee any door of Hope ſet open for my Soul, till Chriſt in his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was Revealed in me; and then I knew him to be a Saviour. Well, with this Joy I have continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this Hour, holding and keeping my ground againſt all Temptations, with great numbers of which I have been Aſſaulted ever ſince, and ſuch as have been ſcarce heard of. For after I had Solemnized, and Celebrated my New Life (begun in anothers Righteouſneſs, and another ſelf) by compoſing and ſinging of Pſalms, Hymns, Spiritual Songs, and continual open-hearted returns of Prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to my ſelf, whilſt the Angels ſeemed to rejoyce with me; yet Satan my conſtant and unwearied Enemy, began now to muſter up afreſh more trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles againſt me, and to follow me with an Hoſt of Afflictions and Tryals, as <hi>Pharaoh</hi> followed <hi>Iſrael,</hi> with a purpoſe to deſtroy them, when once out of his Territories; but my God whom I unfeignedly ſerve from my Soul, did deliver me, does deliver me, and I truſt will deliver me, as the Apoſtle ſays, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.</p>
               <p>For though Satan laid many Snares, and ſo beſet me about, that it ſeemed ſcarce poſſible I ſhould eſcape; yet the Lord ſet me at liberty from the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:153892:19"/> Snares of the Fowler, though ſometimes ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilly planted, that I could not diſcern them; and what he could not do by Inſinuations and Subtilties, and with inward Motions and Temptations, he tryed to compaſs by Violence, in Tormenting me, and making me a miſerable Object of Affliction and Sorrow. For now my Friends became mine Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and my preciſeneſs was an eyeſore to many. My near Relations caſt me off, and I was lookt upon as diſobedient, for keeping company with ſuch Godly Men, as were then called Puritans and Roundheads, and for Praying and holding Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with them, though commanded to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; at length I found ſo little love from ſome, and ſo much malice from others, that I was turn'd out of Doors, and was forc't to ſeek my Fortune, as they ſay, and to fly with my own Feathers, having not above three Shillings in my Pocket, to Travel up and down with in ſtrange Countries in the midſt of VVinter, ſo that I was often up to the knees in Snow, whilſt the very Iſicles hung on my Hair and Cheeks, which a ſhower of Tears would ſometimes thaw, falling abundantly from me in the open Fields and High-ways, where none but God was witneſs of them. I many times uſed to beg at poor Houſes and Cottages, that I might come in to warm and dry me, or for a draught of ſmall Beer, which would make ſome poor Souls fall a weeping to ſee me. After many dangers and troubles, I footed it as far as <hi>Cambridge,</hi> where I ſought from one Colledge to another, to be but a Sizer or poor Scholler, my little ſtock of Money being all gone; but the Servitors of Kings-Colledge, of which I was one before, being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, I could get no place, and I had no Money and wanted Bread, inſomuch that I was forced for Life to try all things, and to eat Leather old quil,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:153892:19"/> and pens, which I pickt up out of the duſt and dunghils, and roaſted in a few Coals, which were left in the Chamber where I was; yea, at length I tryed to eat Graſs, and did it, and my Drink was only fair water; nay, I grew to that height of Penury and Famine, that I tryed to eat my own Fingers, biting them till I could endure it no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; then tearing my Hair, and crying, I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Prayer, whereby my Paſſion would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be allayed for the preſent.</p>
               <p>This continued ſo long, that I met with Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in this VVilderneſs, to try to turn Stones into Bread; the Devil often Tempted me to ſtudy Necromancy, Magick, Conjuration or the Black Art, as it is called, and to make a League with him, and then I ſhould never want, but have Bags of Gold and Silver, and be owned by my Friends, and Honoured of all Men, and return home with great Reſpect and Riches; yet the Lord would not ſuffer me to hearken to him, but to Reſiſt and tell him; <q>Thou art a Lyar from the beginning, away thou Malicious Accuſer of the Brethren, Tempt me not, for thou didſt do thus to my Bleſſed Lord and Maſter Jeſus Chriſt; but he overcame thee, and ſo I truſt ſhall I by his Strength and Power;</q> Then I Prayed and Read the Scriptures, and VVrit Holy Meditations, and Soul Soliloquies on the 88 Pſalm, with ſeveral other Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations upon <hi>Dives</hi> and <hi>Lazarus, &amp;c.</hi> all in Verſe, very Pathetical and Tragical, ſuitable to my condition under ſeveral Temptations; ſo that in ſtead of Aſtrological and Magical Studies, I bent my mind to Sacred Meditations, Soul comforting, Angelical and Evangelical Contemplations; yet I continued under ſtrong Temptations, but to the praiſe of God I ſpeak it, I think I was never a more growing Chriſtian, then after Satan had theſe Repulſes.</p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:153892:20"/>
               <p>But I muſt not omit to declare, that I had one dreadful Temptation firſt, which was almoſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable, had I not been prevented wonderfully, even as I was upon the Execution thereof. For finding my ſelf almoſt ſtarved to Death, my ſtrength near gone, my Eyes ſunk deep in my Head, and my Face wearing Deaths Colours, I was almoſt at my wits end. I confeſs when I felt a violent Paſſion or Fit coming upon me, I would fall to Prayer, Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or the like, whereby ſometimes they were paſt by, and I had much comfort; but yet I could not always avoid them; for now a terrible Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation got ground of me, coming on audaciouſly, growing ſo ſtrong upon me, and following me ſo cloſe, that I could not eſcape it. I took up the Skin of my waſted Hand and Arms, with a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to tear it off for anger, Satan having ſo beſotted me that I could ſee no way to evade Death; I had been beholden to all the Scholars that I found courteous, to bring me Scraps, Skins of ſalt Fiſh, or any other Victuals in their Handke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers or Pockets, which kept me alive a while, till at laſt they all grew weary, and I was almoſt pined to Death, and aſhamed to beg publickly, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly blinded as to any way whereby to recover my ſelf out of this condition; wherefore after violent and never ceaſing Temptations, I drew my Knife, whetted it ſharp, opened my Doublet and Shirt, and in the midſt of the Room where I was alone, I kneeled down to Prayer, to ſurrender up my Soul into the Hands of God; my Knife lay by me ready, and I was prepared for the Act, when behold a Door which I thought bolted the Night before, yet was only ſhut too, was now opened by a Scholar, which with the Screeking of it made me ſtart up, and haſtily throw my Knife in the Chimney, being much aſhamed of what I was going to do; in comes

               <p>By this means I was recovered out of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Danger, and after the Scholar was gone, did exceedingly reprove and check my ſelf for ſuffering this Temptation to grow ſo upon me for want of Faith, and was much afflicted at it, and the more becauſe this Mercy came in ſo ſeaſonably upon it; Oh that I could not wait upon God; at night after Prayer, I went as uſually, ſupperleſs to Bed, and then my Heart melted into abundance of Tears; firſt for the ſin that I was about to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit, and that I could not Believe, and Reſiſt the Devil, as I had done in God's ſtrength before; and then for the Love of God, and his Fatherly care appearing for me at that inſtant, when I took no care at all, but had Devoted my ſelf to Death, that at this very Moment he ſhould not only deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me, but ſend me News full of Hopes; Oh! how did theſe things break my Heart, and work upon me moſt part of the night, untill with an Heart full, and Head full, and Eyes full and all, I fell into a deep ſleep; and was viſited with an extraordinary Token from on High, both in Dream and Viſion, which I imagine was afterward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:153892:21"/> that have gone before you, which will be a great help to you, and you ſhall walk chearfully on in the way which is clear to you, and ſhall ſee no other; but yet you muſt meet with the fair Houſe on the left Hand, that is, the Glory and Great ones of the World, who make a great and fair ſhew to Men, as if built High; but they muſt fall, and are only on the left Hand of you, whilſt you will Deſpiſe and Preach againſt them, and turn your Eye forward, to go in the way of God without turning about. By the Beam that came out of this Houſe, is meant the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Opinions of theſe, who when you ſhall croſs or ſtep aſide, or will not ſtoop under them, they are ſet on fire, and inflamed on a ſudden; but be not troubled, go forward, although they ſend after you, ſaying, you have brought this fire upon them, and though they falſly accuſe you, and ſeek to hawl you to Priſon for this fact, whereof you are altogether Innocent.</q> At which I awaked again, it being about Day-break, won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring with my ſelf what it ſhould mean, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily believing it to be more than ordinary, and being filled with confidence and comfort, I roſe up and writ it down preſently. Next day I went away to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Huntington-Shire,</hi> where I was accepted and entertained, and had a comfortable Maintenance for ſeveral years.</p>
               <p>But after all theſe Deliverances, I Multiplyed abundantly in Gifts and Graces, either to Pray, Expound, Read, Sing Hymns, and Spiritual Songs with the Spirit, and Underſtanding; and as <hi>Iſrael, Exod.</hi> 1. the more he was Afflicted, he Multiplyed the more; ſo, Bleſſed be the Lord, I was the more filled with the Spirit, endued with ſtrength and grace, and refreſhed with Peace and Joy, the more I had ſuffered; ſo that all my troubles were
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:153892:22"/> through Grace, but as <hi>Joſephs</hi> ſtep, to Higher En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments; and finding the Lord ſo abundantly to endue me from above, and to Qualifie me for the Call that I had before in the Night for the Miniſtry, (which I little thought or imagined could have come to paſs, my Friends having often reſolved on the contrary) and all things ſo fairly concurring, I was much confirmed, that the Lord had deſigned me thereunto; and not long after I was by a Godly People earneſtly importuned, and at length grevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with to Preach the Goſpel, and was ſoon known about the Country; ſo although I have ever ſince met with ſeveral Afflictions, Oppoſitions, and Troubles, yet many have given Teſtimony to the Word I have Preached in divers places, the Lord be praiſed, to the great refreſhing of my Soul, and toward the filling up of my Joy, when I ſhall give an account to their comfort at the Great Day of the Lord.</p>

Whilſt I continued in <hi>England,</hi> I began to be convinced, by hearing ſeveral good Men, of the heinouſneſs of my ſins, and wicked diſobedience, and was thereupon ſadly afflicted and diſconſolate, ſo that I could have no quiet nor reſt.</p>
               <p>In this time my Father hearing where I was, (not knowing before what was become of me, doubting I might be dead or drowned) writ a Letter to me, wherein I was admoniſhed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of ſuch as run headlong to Perdition, with many other good advices, he ſeeming like old <hi>Jacob,</hi> to rejoyce that his Son was yet alive, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe things ſtruck me heavily to the Heart, ſo that I lay long under the fearful Sentence of my Iniquities and Diſobedience, and could receive no comfort nor ſatisfaction. I concealed this my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Grief and Torment, till my Heart was ready to burſt, but at length acquainted my Friends therewith, who endeavoured to comfort me, and I had ſome quiet for a ſhort ſpace; but this laſted not, ſo that I ſoon fell again into my old malady and trouble as before, being ſo exceedingly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed that I could by no means obtain any peace, till that Scripture came into my mind, Iſa. 50.10. <hi>He that ſitteth in Darkneſs, and ſeeth no light, ſhould truſt in the Name bf the Lord, and ſtay himſelf upon his God,</hi> this did much ſupport and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:153892:23"/> me to depend upon God, whereby I had abundance of conſolation. Yet I was ſeldom free from many Temptations, Fears, and Doubts; and ſuch ſometimes as did much diſquiet me, untill once that I had a Divine Dream, which hath been very ſweet to my Soul ever ſince; for in my Dream I thought I was told, that God's love was free in Jeſus Chriſt, and beſtowed upon poor ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners through his Merits, and that he put none by, neither turned any away that came to him in and through his Dear Son, and that I need not fear but I was one of them that ſhould be accepted and received to Mercy. This brought much Joy to my Heart, and the ſenſe of it remains to this very day. Afterward I went to <hi>New-England,</hi> and had much comfort from them, and from their Miniſters, and ſince my return, I have had great peace of Mind, and deſire to live in Union with Chriſt, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with his Servants, as long as I am upon Earth; and I have grounded hopes of living with him when I dye, and with all his Saints, to enjoy his Bliſsfull preſence to Eternal Ages.

               </head>
               <p>MY Experiences of the Mercy and Love of God, are more than I can expreſs; the firſt main work upon my Spirit, was on a ſudden, upon an Alarm given to our Troop, while I was a Souldier, which had ſuch a convincing effect upon me, that I lay long under the Apprehenſion of Gods Wrath, and was much diſquieted; ſo that though I Prayed, and Prayed, yet I could take no comfort, and had no confidence in the Mercy of God, but Confuſion was before my Face. Afterward I came to <hi>Dublin,</hi> where I was impeached for breaking an Article of War, and was condemned to loſe my Life for the ſame; whilſt I was in Priſon, I had dreadful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of Hell in my Soul, and could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but weep, and mourn, and pray, counting my Life to be loſt, and yet I was more troubled for the wrath of God, then the wrath of Man; But at length it pleaſed God to give me comfort, for one Night whilſt I was bemoaning my ſelf, and in much Deſpair, on a ſudden the room was all in a flame, and I thought my ſelf in the midſt of Lightning, and being terrified, I imagined I ſaw theſe words written againſt the Wall, <hi>Thy ſins are Pardoned, and thy Life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi> This extraordinary Manifeſtation, much eaſed the Trouble and Sorrow wherein I was; but yet for
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:153892:25"/> want of Faith, this comfort did not long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue with me; for after that, I thought, I ſaw the Lord with ſuch a wrathful countenance, that I durſt not look upon him; and the next news that I heard was, that I was ordered to be ſhot to Death; Oh! then I cannot expreſs the terrors that I was in; my woful miſery was ſuch, that neither Prayers, reading of the Scriptures, nor the pretious promiſes therein, could afford me any Relief, for I could not believe that I had any right to them, and therefore could not lay hold of them. In this dreadfull Diſtreſs I lay, a condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Man both in Soul and Body, lamenting my wretched condition, when opening the Bible in <hi>Joel.</hi> 2.13. I ſaw it thus written. <hi>Turn ye to the Lord God, for he is Gracious and Merciful, ſlow to Anger, and of great Tenderneſs, and Repenteth him of the Evil.</hi> Hereupon I pondered a while, and ſaid, and is he ſuch a God? Well then he is my God; and with that I gave my ſelf up into his Hands, reſolving to relie upon him, let him do what he would with me; and on this Foundation I was Setled and ſatisfied. A while after, it pleaſed the Lord to deliver me out of the danger of Death, and to ſet me at liberty from Priſon; but not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this great Mercy, yet I muſt confeſs that I afterward found ſuch oppoſition in my Heart againſt God, as I could not believe had been in me; I was grievouſly wounded for it, and could have no quiet, but went to Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and acquainted him with it, who told me that I had fallen from my firſt Works, and that I muſt Repent. This rent my Heart, and I had no Reſt; I returned from him and applyed to Prayer, keeping that courſe conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually, till by degrees I was recovered out of that diſconſolate condition, and I praiſe God I have ſince found his favour and kindneſs extended to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:153892:25"/> me, ſo that I am fully perſwaded he loves me, and will pardon my ſins in Jeſus Chriſt, on whoſe Merits I relie, in whoſe Righteouſneſs I reſt, and by whoſe Grace I am now ſet free to ſerve him here, and doubt not but to Reign with him hereafter. <hi>F. B.</hi>

               <p>MY Father was a Gentleman of a fair Eſtate, had many Children, eleven Sons of us; he was High Sheriff, and when he dyed, all our Family were broken, diſperſed, and in confuſion. Two of us were brought up within five Miles of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> but I was placed an Apprentice in <hi>London,</hi> and by this means my ſorrows and troubles began to be great, at firſt from the conſideration of this ſuddain change, which continued a while, but about the 17th year of my Age, my former grief was turned into another kind of Trouble, namely, Sorrow for my ſins; I was for three years together, wounded with the ſenſe of my ſins and corruptions, which were many, I followed Sermons, perſuing the means, was conſtant in Duties and Doing, looking for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that way. I was very preciſe in outward for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities, cenſuring all for Reprobates that wore their Hair long, and not ſhort above their Ears, or that followed the common Modes and Faſhions of thoſe days.

               </head>
               <p>UPon a Lords Day at Night, I being earneſtly Praying to be confirmed in Faith, &amp; in the right
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:153892:27"/> ways of God; After Prayer I went to ſleep, and about five in the Morning, I had the following Dream, and preſently upon my waking, I made haſt to write it down, leſt I ſhould forget any part thereof, it ſeeming very ſtrange to me, and I believing there was ſomething extraordinary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in. My Dream was to this purpoſe.</p>
               <p>I thought I was in the Company of Mr. <hi>R.</hi> the Miniſter, Coll. <hi>H.</hi> and my Lord <hi>C.</hi> and that we were all going together upon a fine green way, in which we Travelled a long time; and then Mr. <hi>R.</hi> turns back to us and ſaid; <q>Brethren you may ſee what a great comfort it is to walk in the Paths of Righteouſneſs; for though we have Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled ſo long, yet we are not at all weary, And Brethren, be aſſured that I will lead you to a place of great Joy and Comfort before it be long, if you will but follow me;</q> Then I Dreamt we went a little further, till we came to a very long and ſpacious place, wherein there was a great Gate, and there Mr. <hi>R.</hi> made a Prayer, and as ſoon as he had concluded, the Gate was opened, and being entred, we went into a great Garden, where was a large pair of Stairs, and going up we ſaw a great many dead Mens Bones, which appeared to Mr. <hi>R.</hi> in full and perfect ſhapes of Men as ever any were, as I conceive, for at thoſe Bones he made a ſtand, and ſaid unto us; <q>Look Brethren, and take good notice of the Handy-work of our Great God; For here you may ſee that they are in as perfect ſhapes, as they were in the lower World.</q> We then proceeded further, and Mr. <hi>R.</hi> made another ſtand, and ſaid unto us: 'Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, now I ſhall ſee whether you are ſtrong in Faith or no; So we came to a place where we muſt needs go over, which appeared to be like a deep Pit, and a ſmall Pike ſeemed to be laid over,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:153892:28"/> it, and Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſaid; <q>Come Brethren, our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney is in vain, unleſs we go over this Pike, for they that will ſee the Habitation of the Lord, muſt go through many Dangers, and I, by the Grace of God will be your Leader.</q> He then went over with as much Safety and Eaſe, as if he had walked on the Earth; Next Coll. <hi>H.</hi> went over with much eaſe alſo, and after him my Lord <hi>C.</hi> It came next to my Turn, but ſeeing ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full a downfall, and the Pike to bend and ſhake ſo much, I was extreamly afraid, and durſt not ſet a foot upon it, whereupon Mr. <hi>R.</hi> cryed out to me, <hi>O Friend, Friend, you have walkt in the Paths of <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs!</hi> He then made a Prayer to Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God, that he would permit me to go over, and afterward bowed three or four times, and cryed out with a loud Voice: <q>Oh thou Great God, how much am I bound unto thee, for thy Loves and Manifeſtations towards me;</q> So ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me by the Hand, he bid me come over and not fear, and then I walked over with as much Safety as the reſt; we then went a little further, and came to a very fair Room, and I could not ſee any one in it, but I conceive that Mr. <hi>R.</hi> and the other two ſaw, and ſpake with God, for after they had done ſpeaking, they gave many Bows and Thanks; And then Mr. <hi>R.</hi> ſaid; <q>Come we will ſing praiſes unto the Lord, for all his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes and great Gifts to us;</q> Hereupon I Dreamt, we began to ſing, and I heard a Multitude of Voi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with rare Muſick; yet could ſee none but our ſelves. When Mr. <hi>R.</hi> had done giving God his Glory, in ſinging his Praiſes, he roſe up and Saluted us, ſaying, <q>Well Brethren, I have but a ſhort time to ſtay here with you: and whilſt I have been amongſt you, I have endeavoured to bring you to the right way to Worſhip God,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:153892:28"/> and for the time I continue with you, I ſhall by the help of God, make known unto you greater things then I have done yet, ſo I deſire you to follow my Counſel, and it ſhall be for your own profit and advantage.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then I waked, or elſe might have known more; This Dream had ſuch an effect and influence upon me, that I could not reſt till I had declared it; and now I find my Heart ever ſince taken off from Sin, and the Luſts of the World, and have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced ſo great a change in being called home to God, as I am not able to expreſs it in words; and am now deſirous to pleaſe God, and to walk in his ways, having been long before wrought upon by the Word Preached, and by Prayer; and now have given my ſelf up to God, in whoſe Mercy alone, through the Merits of Jeſus Chriſt, I expect Joy and Peace here, and Eternal Happineſs hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>J.

               <p>AS to my Life, and Experiences, I muſt declare; That when I was but a little one, God began to work upon me; for going to School, I once hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to Swear an Oath, as I was playing with my Companions, which I had no ſooner uttered, but I was inſtantly ſtruck with horror for it, and the ſence thereof was ſo terrible, that I doubted I ſhould be preſently thrown into Hell for it: In which Fear and great trouble, I left my School Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows playing; the Sorrow and Miſery I thought I was in, would not permit me to ſtay any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; Away I went into the Church Porch not far off, and ſitting down alone, for ſome time wept bitterly to my ſelf; But at length, I know not how, I began to have ſome hopes of Pardon, and thereupon grew chearful and fearleſs, till a while
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:153892:29"/> after, I went to ſee ſome Malefactors Executed; For after I came home, the ſight of their Deaths ran ſo much in my Mind, and appeared ſo continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally before my Eyes, that my ſias, and the horrors of Hell came freſh upon me again, ſo that I was exceedingly caſt down, and cryod out: <hi>Oh! What ſhall I do? How ſhall I be Saved?</hi> Which I had often in my mouth, and in the hearing of my Friends; In this condition I could take no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort from them, till the Lord himſelf brought me out of it, and inclined me to give up my ſelf to Jeſus Chriſt, by the Life of Faith which I now live; Notwithſtanding which, I was under ſeveral Temptations, and oftentimes they came very thick upon me; but even then I reſolved, that if I were thrown into Hell, yet I would ſtill lay hold upon my Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver let him go; and upon his Merits and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I have been Eſtabliſhed through his Grace ever ſince; So that I take Chriſt for my King, Prieſt and Prophet, and do believe him to be a Propitiation for my ſins, and my Portion and Inheritance both here and for ever. <hi>J.

               <p>I have much reaſon to acknowledge a great work of God upon my Heart, in delivering me won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully from ſeveral deſtroying ſins, which once I thought ſlight, but were really ſo great, that I can ſcarce expreſs them; I was very Extravagant, and brought very low both in Body and Mind, and extreamly ſenſible of Diſobeying my Parents from what the Scripture ſays of Men in the latter times, that they ſhall be <hi>Lovers of themſelves, Heady, Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient to their Parents, &amp;c.</hi> The Serious conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration hereof caſt me down, afflicted my Confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſo troubled me, that I was altogether comfortleſs; Thus I continued a long time, till

And yet for all this I was under much temptation, and too much inclined to drinking, till my Brother <hi>Strong</hi> reproved me, ſaying, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I hear ſtrange things of you, that you are given to drinking; This ſo ſmote me, together with the abuſes I received from the prophane ſort, who cryed out after me, <hi>O this is one of</hi> Fowler<hi>'s fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers!</hi> that I was wounded in my ſpirit a long time, to think that I ſhould bring ſuch a ſcandal upon the Goſpel; For two months I was wofully tormented in my mind, till the Lord recovered me, and gave me reſolution and power againſt this and all other ſins, which hath continued with me ever ſince, and for which I acknowledge his great love and mercy to me, and do live upon Chriſt the true <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom I believe to have died for my ſins, and that he will ſave my Soul.</p>

               <p>WHen I take a view of my Life upon the Stage of this World, I may very well compare it to a Trage-Comedy, a Labyrinth from one ſin to another, from one affliction to another. I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Daughter of very good and honeſt Parents, who diligently brought up their Children in the fear of God. My Mother, who in her days was noted for a godly, virtuous and religious Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman; ſhe, I ſay, from amongſt twelve Children, choſe me to ſet her love and affection upon, ſhe
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:153892:30"/> told me, it was becauſe ſhe ſaw ſomething a more tractableneſs and and diligence to pleaſe her th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n in the reſt, which when I perceived, as then not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeven years old, I laid my ſelf forth the more to give her content, who took great delight to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct me, to hear me read, and ask her queſtions. She allotted me a portion of Scripture every day, as likewiſe a part of <hi>Eraſmus Rotterdamus</hi> upon the four Evangeliſts, wherein we both took great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
               <p>About that time I had ſerious thoughts concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, who putting this part of Scripture into my mind, <hi>He that is aſhamed of me before men, of him will I be aſhamed before my Father which is in Heaven; and whoſo denieth me before men, him will I deny before the Angels which are in Heaven:</hi> I then began to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine my ſelf on this manner, <q>What wouldſt thou do, if thou wert tempted, amongſt diverſities of Opinions, to be aſhamed of this Profeſſion wherein thy Parents nurtured thee? What wouldſt thou do, if thou ſhouldſt be tempted to deny Chriſt, and be called to ſuffer for his ſake, as ſome of thy kindred were in Queen <hi>Maries</hi> time? wouldſt thou not deny thy Maſter? wouldſt thou not run away from thy colours?</q> I reſolved, that I would not: And if the Lord would be plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to try me, he ſhould ſee how valiantly I would fight under his Banner, and what a faithful Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier I would be; to this I did implore his help continually; whatſoever I was about, ſtill my heart was praying, and I deſired that God would be pleaſed to awake me in the night, that I might riſe out of my Bed to prayer, which many times I did.</p>
               <p>After this manner I ſpent my days, until I was twelve years old, at which time it pleaſed God to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:153892:30"/> take my Mother from me, which was ſome ſorrow to me, but being ſuddenly made my Father's houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper, ſo as it were a Mother to ten Children, a Miſtreſs over ſix Servants, none to do any thing without my command or conſent, being as it were my Father's right hand, from whom I had this Authority; it did not only ſtop my ſorrow, but cauſed an exceeding joyful pride, or proud joy to ſeize upon my heart, ſeeing my ſelf as it were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, being reſpected amongſt the chiefeſt of the Pariſh, who were my Mothers companions, I repreſenting her perſon when I was amongſt them; then began the cares of the World, and the deceivableneſs of vanities to ſeize upon my heart, and made me forget my former order, promiſes, and intentions; and thus I ſpent almoſt ſeven years, cumbred about many things, but quite neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting that one thing which is needful.</p>
               <p>About this time, it pleaſed God to take my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from me, upon a ſudden. I asked my heart, <q>What was the cauſe of my Father's death? It made anſwer thus, Becauſe thou haſt ſinned againſt God, thou haſt not only omitted much good, but thou haſt committed much evil, thou haſt ſpent thy time idly, and looſely, and for thy ſake all thy Brothers and Siſters are now made Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs and Motherleſs.</q> This conſideration made ſuch a deep impreſſion upon my ſpirit, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed all comfort for half a year, crying out con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, <hi>My ſins, my ſins, woe is me, my ſins!</hi> being demanded by divers godly friends, and reverend Divines, what thoſe ſins were which ſo much troubled me? I told them, <hi>ſins of omiſſion, ſins of omiſſion;</hi> they would perſwade me that I was young, and that I had not years enough over my head to be guilty of ſo many ſins by omiſſion, that needed ſo much ſorrow, I told them that I was
<pb facs="tcp:153892:31"/> old enough to offend God, and to provoke him to anger; indeed, I could not give ſo ready account of my ſins, of evil committed, and of good omitted; but though they never took notice of my ſins, yet my heart was witneſs againſt me: Thus I wearied all my Friends with my exceſſive ſorrow, who knew not what to do for me more than they had done. With one conſent they ſent me up to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> perſwading me that the Word of God was more plentifully Preached there, which made me willing to come. But miſſing of my Brother, to whom I was ſent, to be provided for, and reſolving to wait upon ſome Gentlewoman until I could with conveniency return down again, God by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence brought me to the Wife of Dr. <hi>Page,</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter of <hi>Debtford,</hi> from whom I received great comfort, but in a ſhort time God took him from us all, whoſe death was greatly lamented. I found much favour and love from all that knew me, and moſt eſpecially from Mris. <hi>Page,</hi> who for three years and an half, would not ſuffer me to be away from her one day.</p>
               <p>At the end of which time I was married to her eldeſt Son then living; we had not been long married, and my Husband received his Portion, but we took a houſe in <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> intending to take ſome honeſt courſe for a livelihood, but there, God knows, we fell acquainted with ſome company which did not only cauſe much time to be ſpent in idleneſs, but almoſt all our means. One man eſpecially who gave his mind to drinking, and other vices more than any good, he, I ſay, was never well contented without my Husband's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Seeing imminent danger to hang over our heads by reaſon of this courſe of life, I greatly deſired my Husband to refrain that man's company, or at leaſt not to ſuffer him to come ſo often home
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:153892:31"/> to our houſe; This I begged upon my knees with tears, but could not prevail; then did the Devil ſet his foot into my heart, and perſwade me that by the committing of one ſin, I ſhould prevent many, and ſo ſtirred me up to murther him, to which ſuggeſtion <hi>I</hi> cowardly yielded, and ſought all opportunities to perform this wicked act. Here <hi>I</hi> denied my Maſter Chriſt. In the higheſt of this hatred, in my ſleep, <hi>I</hi> thought <hi>I</hi> was in a very large Chamber, ſitting behind a Table covered with a green Carpet, upon which lay all manner of Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which proclaim death; ſuddenly the man came into the Chamber, whom, ſo ſoon as <hi>I</hi> eſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be alone, catching up a weapon in my hand, <hi>I</hi> reſolved there to commit the horrid act of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon his body; but God, who watcheth over his, whether they ſleep or wake, and worketh by means, and without means, which way he pleaſeth, at that time put an end to all my revengeful thoughts, and cauſed me to hear a voice in my Ear, ſaying, <hi>Vengeance is mine;</hi> to which voice <hi>I</hi> anſwered aloud, <hi>And, thou wilt repay, O Lord;</hi> Then waking, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf ſpeak, <hi>I</hi> was in very good charity with him, and left my wrong to God, but reflecting upon mine own heart, there <hi>I</hi> found not only theſe, but a whole neſt of moſt Diabolical and wicked intentions, which my God was pleaſed by his preventing graces to ſmother in their birth, for <hi>I</hi> no ſooner had concluded, that <hi>I</hi> would fulfil mine own hearts luſt, although <hi>I</hi> ſuffered all the puniſhments due for ſuch and ſuch like ſins; wherein <hi>I</hi> ran away from my Captain, yet for all this he had a favour towards me, and ſent an Herauld after me to bring me back again.</p>
               <p>But then began a freſh Battel, for my God coming as it were, to ſee what uſe <hi>I</hi> had made of the Talent that he had given me, he found it, not only wrapt
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:153892:32"/> up in a napkin, but exceedingly abuſed; and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my heart, what found he there, but a ſink of ſin, a Cage of unclean Birds, and Den of Theeves, a place for Dragons, for the Scritchowl, and for the Satyre? theſe had taken full poſſeſſion, there was no room for my God, they kept him out, and what did they there, but made it like a troubled Sea? Firſt, telling me my ſins were greater than could be forgiven. <q>Doſt thou not know (ſaid they) that thy thought ſins are ſufficient to damn thee, although thou haſt never committed any actually? doth not the Scripture ſay plainly, if a Man luſt after a Woman he hath committed Adultery?</q> which commandment being broken, brings death. I then took a view of all the ten Commandments written in the Moral Law, to ſee which of them I had broken, and which I had kept, I found them all broken, and at the end of every one was written <hi>Death:</hi> And not only theſe, but thoſe ſweet commands of my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, wherein he bids us watch, and pray for your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, feed the hungry, cloath the naked, love one another, all which I had likewiſe broken, which made me to ſee nothing to remain for me but death and damnation. I argued then with my ſelf on this wiſe, <q>I have read, and I have heard, that Almighty God, which by his power made Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth, and all therein, had ſent his Son to dye for ſinners, and that there was hopes through his death that I ſhould get pardon;</q> I had no ſooner caſt mine eye upon my God and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, but I was daſhed from all: Mine enemy Satan poſſeſſing my thoughts, ſuggeſted thus un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Fond Fool (quoth he) why doſt thou thus trouble thy ſelf? take thy pleaſure, do what thou likeſt, thou ſhalt never be called to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:153892:32"/> for any thing: for as the wiſe man dyeth, ſo dyeth the fool, and both reſt in the grave to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; there is no God to ſave thee or to pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh thee, all things were made by nature, and when thou dyeſt, there is an end of all thy good and bad deeds; thou talkeſt of the Scripture, and of a God, and of a Jeſus which thou haſt heard of there; ſee thy ſimplicity now, how canſt thou prove the Scriptures to be true? alas they were made by mens inventions, there is no hold for thee to take there.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus being unquiet, I ſpent my days and nights in tears and ſighs, and groans, ſometimes thinking with my ſelf <hi>If I ſhall be ſaved, why am I thus?</hi> Then again, concluding that there was no <q>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, no God, no Jeſus, no good Angels, only an Hell there was, and Devils to carry me thither, who waited in every corner, and behind every door to ſnatch me away:</q> And I ſaw there was no remedy, but the more I ſtrove, the faſter I ſtuck, I fainted, and laid down mine arms, and cowardly yielded to the enemy, arguing with my ſelf, <q>if I am a firebrand of Hell, a child of perdition, a limb of Satan, and my portion is to be with the Devil and his Angels: Why live I longer up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Earth?</q> why go I not to mine own place? Thus content to periſh, I wandred about the ſpace of half a year; no Man nor Woman was privy to, nor knew the leaſt of all my thoughts; at length concluding that the night enſuing, would be my laſt night that I ſhould ſtay here on Earth, as one deſiring to be at home, I careleſly left my Family and went to bed, as it were, <hi>inviting the Devils to come and take their due;</hi> but mark I pray you, the goodneſs of our God, who was with me all this while<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I was not aware of it, for even that ſame night, The little dog leaping upon the bed, I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:153892:33"/> thought it was the Devil who was come to fetch me away; I ſcreamed forth aloud; but when I perceived it was the dog, and not the Devil, I began to think, Thut <hi>ſurely there was a God that had preſerved me all this while.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In a moſt grievous agony I ſpent that night weeping, and although it was Winter, yet I ſweat that the water ran from off every part of my Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Being in this ſad condition, I thought it was not right, but ſurely ſome means might be uſed to get out of it. And riſing the more early in the morning, went up into the higheſt room that was in the Houſe, and looked forth at the window to ſee if I could ſee God; there I beheld the Trees to grow, the Birds to flye, the Heavens how they hanged, and all things that were before me, then I thought they could not make themſelves, no more than I could make my ſelf, and that we muſt needs have a Maker, and this Maker muſt be ſtrong and powerful; Then I fell down upon my knees, crying out in this manner, <q>O God, if there be a God, ſhew thy ſelf to me a poor mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable wretch, that I am at the point to periſh;</q> Then I thought I ſaw the Lord, but with a frown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing countenance he looked upon me, as if he had ſaid, <q>Thou haſt diſpleaſed me, and I will not hear thee, and turning his back went from me, which ſight was as a dart thruſt through my Soul;</q> for the ſpace of half an hour, divers thoughts entred into my Heart, but before I roſe from off my knees, I reſolved to become an earneſt ſuter to him, and not to do any thing more that ſhould diſpleaſe him, hoping that he would be intreated for that which was paſt.</p>
               <p>But now, I beſeech you godly Chriſtians, to take notice of the wonderfull workings of our good God, whoſe judgements are unſearchable,

He had called many times at the door of my heart, and had but ſmall and ſlight entertainment, but now he came vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently and powerfully to take poſſeſſion of his own, and ſet me about his work in my ſelf: Then I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to think what I ſhould do, and whether I ſhould go to pacifie the wrath of this terrible and dreadfull God, by whoſe providence I was brought to a Church in <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry godly and reverend Divine, was preaching a Funeral Sermon, I went in, hoping to hear ſome comfort, giving attentive heed, his Text was, <hi>With my dead body they ſhall ariſe;</hi> ſee here, my God did not only make a ſcourge of ſmall cords, and whipped out the buyers and ſellers, but he did over-turn, and overturn, and overturn; for this Miniſter did not only preach to the people, but ſhewed me, as it were in a looking glaſs, mine own condition, and told me that by the gates of Hell many times God was pleaſed to bring his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to Heaven; being hungry and thirſty, I was glad of a little food; and preſently catcht hold of that word; Is it ſo thought I, then there is comfort for me, I will about my work, if it pleaſe God to aſſiſt me: In his Sermon he asked divers queſtions, to which my heart made anſwer, ſo that I came home joyfull, longing to hear more of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which fell out as if it had been on purpoſe for my ſake, ſo that for a month, or five weeks, I heard two, three, four, or five Sermons, from him conſtantly every week, wherein he bid me try and prove whether I had Faith or no, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I did hate my ſins or no, and what have been the ſigns and fruits thereof: He likewiſe bid me ſearch the Scriptures, for they are true, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare my condition with the children of God there; But after he was ſenſible of my condition, which
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:153892:34"/> I made known to him privately, he was very labo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rious to bring my Soul out of the jaws of Death, and to raiſe it up to Jeſus Chriſt, for which pains, I hope my God will reward him to his everlaſting comfort.</p>
               <p>But one thing I had almoſt forgot. When I was in the depth of my ſpiritual dejection, I was utterly denyed all outward comforts, my God hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his face I was troubled, the Sun, the Moon, and the Stars, ſeemed in their courſes to fight againſt me, my neighbours fell out with me, and mocked me, my kindred deſerted me, my Captain Chriſt offended, made me run the gauntlet, and every Souldier had a laſh at me, whatſoever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto me, brought ſorrow to my heart.</p>
               <p>But when I was perſwaded that the Scriptures were true, I ſet my ſelf to ſearch them, to ſee what comfort I could find there; beginning at the Alpha of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> I found, In the beginning God created the Heaven, and the Earth, and all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; Well then, though I, there is a God; but viewing a little further, I found this God offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and Man in a loſt condition, but preſently a remedy promiſed; going on, I found the Paſchal Lamb, the brazen Serpent, the bunch of Grapes, the ſcape Goat, and divers other things to be types of that promiſed Seed; I likewiſe took a view of the afflictions of <hi>Joſeph, David,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> that did much eaſe my grief. Coming to that place where my God ſpake by his Prophet, <q>Come, let us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon together, though your ſins were as ſcarlet, I will make them as white as ſnow, though they were like crimſon, they ſhall be like wool; And though you had lain among the pots, yet ſhall ye be like doves wings, covered over with ſilver;</q> Then I thought, will the Lord reaſon with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners? will he vouchſafe a Parley? O that I were
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:153892:34"/> able to anſwer him one of a thouſand! O that theſe promiſes belonged unto me! O that this God were reconciled unto me! How happy ſhould I be; how happy is that man <hi>whoſe Tranſgreſſions are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given, and whoſe ſins are covered?</hi> O, how bleſſed is that man <hi>unto whom the Lord imputeth no ſin!</hi> I found the ſame Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> propheſie of my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viours birth in his 9th Chapter, and in his 53, he lively ſets forth his Paſſion, and in the 55, the Lord inviting me with a Proclamation; <hi>Ho, every one that thirſteth, come;</hi> then I anſwered, Lord, I would fain come, but how ſhall I come? I have nothing to bring to pacifie thine anger, O that I could ſee thee ſmile upon me, as once I ſaw thee frown, how happy ſhould I be: then I called to mind that I had heard, and read, that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>ſhed his blood for ſinners, and that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould be ſaved;</hi> and I was ſomething incouraged to petition in his Name on this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>Heal me O Lord, and I ſhall be healed; turn me, and I ſhall be turned; convert me, and I ſhall be converted. O ſave me, my God, and I ſhall be ſaved; take away this ſtony heart of mine, and give me an heart of fleſh, renew a right Spirit within me, reſtore me to thoſe joys that I was wont to find in thee, for thy loving kindneſs is better than thouſands of Rivers of Oyl; O caſt me not away whom thou haſt had ſo much patience withal; O caſt me not away whom thou haſt bought with ſo dear a price; O forſake me not in this my great neceſſity, O look upon that ever-ſtreaming fountain of thy Sons blood, which is poured forth for all them that believe; Lord I believe, help thou my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief; O pardon, pardon I beſeech thee, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give me all my ſins, my Sermon-ſins, my Sabbath-ſins,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:153892:35"/> my every-days ſins, my other peoples ſins, my ſins of omiſſion, my ſins of commiſſion, my ſins of ignorance, my ſins of knowledge, my ſins of preſumption, my ſins of willfulneſs; O Lord, forgive me my known and ſecret ſins, O pardon the ſins that I have committed this day, O ſpeak the word only, and thy Servant ſhall be healed, Amen.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus when the Lord had opened my mouth to ſpeak unto him, I gathered a great deal of ſtrength, and had much hope that he would be intreated; but not ſetting ſo great an eſteem on my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt as I ought, I thought I <hi>muſt bring ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with me to pacifie my God; I thought I muſt make my ſelf all fair,</hi> and beautiful, before my God would love me, but how to do this I knew not; for the ſpace of eleven years I ſought all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities to pleaſe him, yet when I examined my ways, works, and actions, I found they were ſo far from pleaſing him, that they were rather motives to ſtir him up to anger, if he ſhould be ſevere to mark what I did amiſs; many times I thought upon the ſad condition that I had been in, and how the Lord had reſtored me. then my heart was elevated and over-joyed; I found a great deal of love in my ſelf towards God, but was not ſure of Gods love to me, which I eſteemed above all the World; the honour of God was ſo dear unto me, that I could ſometimes ſay unto him, <q>Lord if there be no way to bring honour to thy Name, but by my confuſion, then let me be confounded; but ſure Lord, thou maiſt gain more glory in ſaving me, than in damning me, the dead cannot bring honour to thy Name, for who ſhall give thee thanks in the pit? the living, the living, they ſhall praiſe thee, as I hope to do hereafter.</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:153892:35"/>
               <p>Many times I prayed, and had many petitions granted me preſently, and at other times I prayed, and was denyed what I begged, but had what I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired in a better way; in all Diſpenſations I found my God with me, either with his preventing, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, or ſupporting graces, I received innume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable favours from him, yet could I not be perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that they came from his love, but that rather they were to augment my ſcore; I was ſtill la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring and inquiring how I might come to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured of Gods love, which he was pleaſed at length to ſhew me in ſome meaſure, on this manner; In the ſixt of <hi>John</hi> I hear my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt telling me, <q>that I cannot come to him except God our Father draw me, and if I come to him, him, he will in no wiſe caſt me out, but will raiſe me up at the laſt day;</q> I am perſwaded, that it was my God alone that did draw me to my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Jeſus Chriſt, that will receive me, and will raiſe me up at the laſt Day. In <hi>John</hi> 17. I hear him praying to his Father for me, whoſe requeſt I am confident ſhall not be denyed.</p>
               <p>Nay further, by faith I ſee my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt ſuffering for me, nailed upon the Croſs for me, wounded, buffeted, ſtript, and ſpit upon for me; dead, buryed, roſe again, aſcended into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſitteth on the right hand of his Father, and my God, making interceſſion for me; which gives me aſſurance of my Gods everlaſting and unchangeable love, in, and through my Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, towards me, and that not for any thing that was in me, but for his ſake, he ſaid unto me, <hi>when I was in my blood, live;</hi> and I know I do believe and am regenerated by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe I find ſuch an alteration in my ſelf, that whereas before I could not believe there was a

                  </gap> fit of Sickneſs, and a grievous touch in my Conſcience for that ſin committed againſt God, and my Siſter, that I ſaw nothing but deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and feared that the horrors of Hell-fire would ſeize on my Soul and Body for this ſin, and Satan told me, that there was no Salvation for me, for God knew me not, neither would he own me;
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:153892:36"/> but if I would either hang my ſelf, or cut my throat, or take the bedſtaff to thruſt down my throat, then I ſhould never be tormented more, but look how an Ox dyed, ſo ſhould I. Then I cryed out to my Parents, and ſaid, that I was dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and that there was no Salvation for me, but that I muſt go to Hell; my Parents watched me, and ſearched narrowly to ſee what inſtruments I had prepared: Then the Devil tempted me to rend the pillow, and pick out ſome of the feathers to ſwallow them down, which I did, and it had like to have coſt me my life, for I was very nigh death by this means.</p>
               <p>My Parents ſent for a Doctor to adminiſter ſome things to me, which he did, and when I was a little rccovered, they ſent for Mr. <hi>Knewſtubs</hi> Miniſter in <hi>Edmonds-bury,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> Miniſter of <hi>Dedham,</hi> who took a great deal of pains with me, and asked me whom I did believe in; I told them that I did believe in God that he would damn me; they asked me, if God would damn me becauſe I did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in him; I anſwered no, but it was for that ſin committed againſt God, and my innocent ſiſter; they asked me, whether I was not ſorry for that act, I told them yes, I had cauſe enough to be ſorry, for I muſt be damned for that ſin; then they asked me if I was ſorry with all my heart for my offences. I told them I had great reaſon to be ſorry, for by this I had loſt the love of God, and my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in Jeſus Chriſt; they replyed, that Chriſt had left ſweet comforts for penitent ſinners, and they were to adminiſter it unto them: But I reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it was for ſuch a ſinner as I was; for there could be no Salvation for me: They told me Chriſt dyed for ſinners, and ſuch ſinners as I was, for they ſaid I was a penitent ſinner; but I replyed, Chriſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver dyed for ſuch a one as I was, neither could his
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:153892:37"/> mercy ſave me; Then they bid me have a care how I did preſumptuouſly go about to judge my own ſoul, and that I was not fit to judge my ſelf in the condition I was under, for it was a greater ſin in ſo doing, than to comit that ſin of lying againſt God, for God was a God of mercy, but I had no mercy, thus raſhly to judge my own ſoul; I replyed, that they were as bad as I, for they came to help to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry my ſoul into Hell headlong; they told me no, but they would ingage their ſouls for my ſoul, that I ſhould find comfort from them in Chriſt Jeſus; with that I cryed out, O happy day would that be that I might find comfort before my departure; they told me that Chriſt was a Chriſt of tenderneſs, that I was a beloved Chriſtian, and Chriſt was preparing comfort for me, and it was Chriſt that had opened my eyes to ſee my ſin, and he would alſo open my heart to loath ſin, and he would par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don my ſin; yet I told them no, that he would never open my heart but with terror, for I was born to be damned, and muſt be damned; and that Chriſt never dyed for ſuch a ſinner as I was; this I ſpoke with great ſighing; and they asked me what made me think ſo? I told them that I ſaw nothing but Death, and Hell, and confuſion of body and ſoul; they asked me why I ſighed, and wept, ſo ſore? <hi>I</hi> told them becauſe now <hi>I</hi> was going into Hell, for the Devil with his chains was ready to throw me into the utter pit of darkneſs; they ſaid, Wherefore? <hi>I</hi> told them for offending the Lord my Creator, &amp; did wiſh my ſelf to be in Hell, that <hi>I</hi> might be out of miſery, and might no longer feel the vengeance of God; with that they went to prayers, each of them an hour, and when the laſt Miniſter prayed, <hi>I</hi> cryed out, <q>O Lord my God, my King, and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, have mercy upon me a poor diſtreſſed ſinner;</q> Then Maſter <hi>Rogers</hi> came to me, and took me by

               <p>The next morning, I had ſome comfort but that left me again, and I was under the ſame con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of ebbings and flowrings for ſixteen weeks together, before I had any firm hopes of my Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and having taken no reſt a long time, I fell into a ſlumber; and in my ſleep I imagined there did appear unto me a little child in white, with an apple in one hand, and a white wand in the other, and he carried me til I came into a place where I did ſee much terrour of fire, and ſhreeking, and a great deep ditch where was nothing to hold by, yet I muſt go over that burning lake; and he took the white wand and laid it over the ditch, and bad me tread upon it, and fear not, but I refuſed; then he came and took me by the hand and trund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his apple on the wand, which bowled over ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry level, and with that I ſaid, It is the Lord, therefore I will venture, and did venture over with this child in my hand; and when I came to ſhore I cryed out with fear, my Lord, my God and my Saviour, am I in Hell, or am I redeemed out of Hell? with that I awaked, being in a great paſſion and fear, and there being my friends about me, they told me, I was redeemed out of Hell; I asked, How could they tell? had they been there? for I told them that I had been newly there; then I cryed out, Oh! where is that ſweet Babe that was with me? they asked me what Babe, and what was the ſhape of it, I declared unto them as before, and they told me, That it was Jeſus Chriſt that had appeared in the ſhape of a Child, and that he had overcome Death, and Hell, for me; then I cryed out, and ſaid, bleſſed be Jeſus Chriſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:153892:38"/> for evermore, and did intreat thoſe people that were there with my Father, that they would go to prayers for me, that thoſe comfortable revelations which I had ſeen, and my Faith in Chriſt, might never depart from me; yet for three years after I had many ebbings and flowings, and much fear poſſeſſed me, ſo that Satan would tell me I was more afraid of Hell, than of offending God; but I boldly ſat up in my bed, and told Satan, He was a Lyer, and that I would rather be damned than de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo Chriſt did appear very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably to me, and hath, and doth deliver me out of many troubles very often, and how to ſpeak of them I know no end; yet Satan like a cunning Sophiſter hath been tampering with me to deſpair of Chriſt, but it pleaſed the Lord to bring many promiſes into my mind, and the example alſo of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> and of the woman of <hi>Canaan;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving, that as Jeſus Chriſt was gracious to them, ſo he would alſo be to me; and Chriſt hath often times revealed unto me, that his grace was ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for me, as he ſaid unto <hi>Paul;</hi> I can ſpeak but little of Jeſus Chriſt, but yet I am fully perſwaded in my Soul, that I ſhould think my ſelf very hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, even to give my life for the glory and honour of his name, if the Lord would count me but wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of ſuch a favour, and I would not for all the Kingdoms in the world, and the pomp thereof, be in ſuch a condition again; and now my ſoul doth deſire to give up it ſelf unto God, and to walk in the ſtricteſt courſe that his Word doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe. <hi>E.

               </head>
               <p>ABout the fourteenth year of my age I was put out to be an Aprentice, but was placed with a Maſter in whom I ſaw little of God, his ways were contrary to the ways of God, which was a great
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:153892:38"/> trouble to my Spirit; and the more becauſe ſome rude people Drink, Swear, and be very deboyſt with him. Three or four years after, there grew great diſputes amongſt ſome perſons about Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy, Presbytery, Independency, and the like, which made me queſtion with my own thoughts, which was the true way to worſhip God. I apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> the Miniſter, and others, yet was not ſatisfied, but after great perplexity of ſpirit, I meditated with my ſelf, and wondred what would be the end of my troubles, for they had been many, eſpecially temptations to deſpair of ſalvation.</p>
               <p>But afterwards being returned back from my Maſter to my Fathers houſe, lying down once up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a bench I fell aſleep, and dreamed that I was in a green Meddow, where I ſaw various forms of Creatures, ſome furious, others very pleaſing, yet all of them ſeemed monſtruous, and changed their ſhapes often. And beholding my ſelf alone in the middeſt of them, I was grievouſly troubled, and then there ſeemed to appear a great red Dragon; before it came at me I thought a little Child was put in my arms, which was ſo beautiful and comely that I admired it, and was ſo taken with beholding it, that it put the fear of the Dragon for the preſent out of mind; But the Dragon afterwards drew near, and ſorely affrighted me; but both my ſelf and the child were taken away, and carried up an hill, and the Dragon purſued us; and being often rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to fall in running up the hill, I feared that the Dragon would catch me, but my ſtrength being come to me I got up to the top of the hill, and the Dragon made up after me. When I was got up to the top there appeared a brightneſs from Heaven, which guſhed forth like a ſtaſh of Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſplit the Dragon in pieces, at which I
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:153892:39"/> rejoyced exceedingly. Then the Child was put into my Arms again, and I asked it what was its name, it iaid, <hi>Emanuel;</hi> I asked who was its Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it ſaid, <hi>I am,</hi> I asked, who was its Mother, it ſaid, <hi>Eternity,</hi> I asked, from whence he came, he ſaid, <hi>from my Father out of Heaven;</hi> I asked to whom he came, and what was his errand here, he ſaid, <hi>to ſave that which was loſt, and return again;</hi> I asked him, if he would dwell with me while he ſtayed, he ſaid, <hi>he could not be detained according to that frame and figure he was in, but after death he would dwell with me in another frame;</hi> the thought of death grieved me, but the child bid me not <hi>to weep at it, for in this World, that which is beauty muſt be deſtroyed, and that which is contemptible muſt be exalted.</hi> I then ſaw my ſelf very contemptible, and poor, and troubled, and in theſe thoughts the child was taken away from me.</p>
               <p>Then my Father coming into the room made a noiſe, whereat I awaked, much diſtracted, and troubled in my thoughts, and ſo perplexed that I knew not what to do, and the more, by ſeeking to underſtand what I had ſeen, becauſe I knew not how to be ſatisfied, in ſome doubts that lay very ſad and heavy upon my Soul. But I have ſince found much comfort out of Gods <hi>word,</hi> where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> And the Lord ſaith, <hi>I have called thee by name.</hi> And again, he ſaith in another place, <hi>I will bear in thee a poor and afflicted people, and they ſhall ſerve me.</hi> And in <hi>Eſay</hi> he ſaith, <hi>I will gather my Lambs with my Arms, and gently lead thoſe that are with young.</hi> and then he hath promiſed, <hi>That he will never lay more upon his people, then he will enable them to bear.</hi> And I have theſe effects of my faith; 1. My heart is led out to love God, who is eternal, and inviſible, and
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:153892:39"/> incomprehenſible, I love him in all his diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons towards me, and in the meaneſt Creature, though never ſo deſpiſed; I deſire to own God where ever I ſee him. 2. I find my heart very full in duty, yet I have been ſometimes troubled by ſome cholerick diſtempers that have tranſported me in ſome diſputes which I am very ſorry for, and reſolve to leave. 3. I love the Lord, who hath heard my Prayer, and now at laſt ſatisfied me in every ſcruple of my conſcience. 4.

Then Mr. <hi>Young</hi> did open that Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in 1 Theſſ. 1.4, 5. <hi>You ſay that you know Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to be your Saviour, therefore take heed, for Jeſus ſhall appear in flaming fire, againſt all thoſe that know him not, nor obey not his Goſpel;</hi> This put me in great fear and horror, worſe than before. Then I did intreat Mr. <hi>Young</hi> to tell me, what the Goſpel was, and he bid me read in the firſt of <hi>Matth.</hi> and there it was this, that <hi>The Goſpel was the glad tidings to the ſhepherds,</hi> that it was <hi>the good will of God to ſend Jeſus Chriſt to ſave ſinners, whereof</hi> I did confeſs with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> that I <hi>was chief.</hi> Mr. <hi>Young</hi> at parting gave me theſe Inſtructions, That I ſhould be very careful what company I did go into, and that I ſhould always <hi>remember my Creator in the days of my youth,</hi> and this was very freſh in my memory, and did ſtrengthen me very much againſt the temptations of Satan, and kept me from frequenting thoſe Companions that I did formerly uſe; and if at any time, I met them and heard their idle words, then this Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture did often come into my mind, <hi>Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth,</hi> and did very much chear my ſpirits; and carry me along for many years, untill it pleaſed God to bring me to <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> and coming to Black Fryers under the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Dr. <hi>Gouge,</hi> I was very much edified for two years together, but coming to live at <hi>VVeſtminſter,</hi> I did profit but little again, untill it pleaſed God to ſend Mr. <hi>Marſhal,</hi> and hearing of him ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of <hi>Jeremiah</hi> 14. of the famine being in the outward man, but there was the famine or the Word of God at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> it made me very at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to his Doctrine, he complaining what a barbarous place <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> had been, but now he did hope that the Word of God would take effect in the hearts of ſome of his Hearers, and truly ſo
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:153892:40"/> it did on my heart, for I was a conſtant hearer of him, and then going to a friends family, I heard them repeat the Notes that they had taken from Maſter <hi>Marſhal,</hi> and ſince I continued with that Company of Godly people; and now it is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of my Soul to have fellowſhip with the Father and the Son, that my Soul may thrive in grace, and in the knowledge and great love of that God, that ſo loved the World, that he gave his Son to dye to ſave ſuch as I am, and that whoſoever comes to him ſhould not periſh but have eternal life; with whom I beſeech the Lord I may walk in a more cloſe way to the end of my life, than ever I have yet done. <hi>J.

               </head>
               <p>I Have had thoughts concerning my Spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and made ſearch into my Soul touching my eſtate in relation to GOD; and what teſtimony I can find of my intereſt in and converſion to God. And I have found this to be the way of Gods work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring me to himſelf, through his great mercy in the Lord Jeſus. It hath pleaſed God ever ſince I was born, to place me under the means of the Goſpel, the neglect whereof hath been a great trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and grief unto my Soul; this with many ſins more, lay heavy upon my Conſcience, eſpecially ſome offence and wrong offered againſt the People of God, inſomuch that the terrors of Hell laid hold upon me, and I began with <hi>Cain</hi> to cry out, that <hi>my burthen was more than I was able to bear:</hi> I was a damned creature, I was out of the preſence and favour of God, and never like to ſee his face with comfort, ready with <hi>Judas</hi> to deſtroy my ſelf. I continued in thiis condition many years. But God of his exceeding mercy kept me from that great ſin, and at laſt I received ſome comfort, in that the Lord proclaimeth himſelf to be <hi>the Lord
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:153892:41"/> God, gracious, merciful, long-ſuffering, in forgiving ſins,</hi> and that <hi>he deſired not the death of a ſinner, but rather that he ſhould live.</hi> And again he ſaith, <hi>If our ſins were as Scarlet, he will make them as white as Snow or VVooll;</hi> Again, <hi>I am the Lord, and change not, therefore ye Sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not conſumed.</hi> Theſe with many other promiſes of Free Grace and Mercy yielded ſome comfort to my Soul, yet for a long time I was troubled; if I prayed, I feared my prayers were an abomination unto the Lord; at laſt knowing the Lord heard the <hi>Ninivites,</hi> that were Heathens, I thought he was as able to ſave my Soul. And it hath been my care to wait upon God in the means, knowing that <hi>Faith cometh by hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word,</hi> and upon all occaſions to ſearch my own heart, what part of the word belonged unto me, and what did not; I received ſome comfort from theſe promiſes, <hi>I will not break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax; Come unto me all ye that and weary and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt;</hi> and, <hi>He that cometh unto me I will in no wiſe caſt off.</hi> Theſe gracious promiſes, cauſe me to deſire to draw near to God in union, and in communion, with whom I hope for fellowſhip to all eternity. <hi>T.

                  <hi>XV.</hi> Experiences of <hi>M. W.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>VVHen I lived in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and was in ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of outward enjoyments, I had my thoughts much taken up about the things of the World, but little ſeriouſly touching the Salvation of my Soul; but ſome years ſince, being at <hi>Liverpoole</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> I heard a Sermon preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Mr. <hi>Tompſon;</hi> his Text was, <hi>Redeem the time becauſe the days are evil:</hi> Many things he ſpake ſo home to my Soul, that I was very much troubled I had ſpent ſo many days in evil: That I had been covetous, and proud, and impatient in the former days of my life. Yet if pleaſed the Lord, I had
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:153892:41"/> an Husband that was an honeſt Man, and one that feared God, who had often given me good counſel, and perſwaded me to make ſome promiſes of amendment; But I had Children, and Servants, and Cattel, and lived plentifully in <hi>Ireland,</hi> from whence I had lately come with my Husband and Family; and indeed there had been no real conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, though I had often thoughts towards God, and eſpecially I was given much to impatiency, for which my Husband had often reproved me: But ſtill I went on in my ſin, being not ſenſible of my ſad condition therein, until I came into <hi>England:</hi> After which this Sermon of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> did much hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me, and wrought upon my heart a very great ſenſe of my ſins. And I was afraid that I had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the ſin of Blaſphemy againſt God, as <hi>Job</hi> ſaid, his children perhaps had done ſome way or other, becauſe I had ſometimes curſed ſome body, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that had angred me, and in paſſion rapt out ſometimes at Oath; many nights I watered my bed with my tears about it, and went to Mr. <hi>VVeſt</hi> a Miniſter near <hi>Liverpoole,</hi> and other godly people who uſed ſuch means, as God led them forth to, for my comfort; but I was ſtill afflicted in my Soul, about the ſpace of three weeks, and then I found much comfort being perſwaded by good counſel to truſt in God, which I did, and was heartily ſorry for my ſins.</p>
               <p>And then my Husband was troubled in mind him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the Lord made me an inſtrument to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, as well as I could. But about five months after, he had abundance of joy and comfort, and expected death, ſaying, that he was perſwaded he ſhould be killed, and ſo (preſently after he was ſetled in his mind) it fell ſadly out. For the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my took <hi>Liverpool,</hi> and killed my Husband, and a child, both before my face, and ſtript, and woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:153892:42"/> me, and a child of five years old; and it was thought I could not live. And this was a ſtrong try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and I was much tempted, my ſenſes me thought were going from me, and my heart I thought would have rent in pieces, yet I prayed. and the Lord heard me, I thought it was too much for me to bear: But I remembred my Saviours words, <hi>He that will not forſake Father, or Mother, or Siſter, or Brother, or Husband, or Child for Chriſt, is not worthy of him,</hi> and I deſire to give glory to his name. I conſider that I muſt part with all for Chriſt, I ſtrove hard againſt my own weakneſs; and my heart ſaid, that God was juſt in all his dealings with me.</p>
               <p>I thought, when I had conſidered of it, that I did but ſuffer as an evil doer my ſelf; but our cauſe was Gods, and our Enemies Popiſh Rebels; <hi>Paul</hi> was ready not only to ſuffer, but to dye at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> for the name of Chriſt; ſo I took it patiently, giving glory to God, and believing that God, who wus come ſo near me, would not forſake me. I was aſſured with much joy, that the Lord would bring me to himſelf, and in this confidence did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce with my wounded Child, and a little Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a Barn where we were put, having got a piece of an old Bible; and then and ſince I have found much ſettledneſs in my faith from ſeveral Promiſes of the Lord, revealed in his holy Word, ſome of which follow, John 15.7. <hi>If ye abide in me, and my words abide in you, ye ſhall ask what you will, and it ſhall be done unto you.</hi> I truſt in God never to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from his word, and therefore hope to find comfort in the end, and do find comfort in the way, in that Chriſt abideth with me, Matth. 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> Though the Lord hath thus emptyed me of ſome worldly comforts, yet he hath given me an hungring and thirſting Soul af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:153892:42"/> himſelf, and therefore I laid hold of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of bleſſedneſs, as made to me, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> It this I have been, and ſtill am much comforted, in the greateſt afflictions, that God hath laid upon me, in whom alone is true reſt.</p>
               <p>And as further teſtimonies of my love to God, and evidences of my faith, I have theſe comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inferences, which ſpeak much peace to my Soul. 1. My love to God and Chriſt, is more than to all things in the World. 2. I find a great difference in my affections to God, and to the World, and the things thereof; ſo that my Children, which of all worldly things are moſt near and dear to me, yet if God ſhould take them from me, I could freely give them. 3. I find the Spirit ſtriving againſt the fleſh, ſo that when I heard Dr. <hi>Holmes,</hi> ſpeaking of that ſtill voice, which a Believer hears, as it were, from the Spirit, it did ſo inlarge my heart, that for joy and great comfort it made me weep, through the influence of the Spirit ſenſibly then upon my heart; and ſo at other times alſo, I find much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the Spirit of God, which is my greateſt joy. 4. I do rejoyce mightily in the Ordinances, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what I hear to my ſelf, as well as I can, and when I hear any thing againſt any evil that I can apply to my ſelf, the Lord draws forth my heart frequently to pray to God, that I may do nothing that may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſe him. And I thank my God, I find a full willingneſs in deſire, and affection to ſubmit to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry truth of Jeſus Chriſt. 5. When I hear comforts ſpoken of that concern me, I am ſo joyful, that it fills my heart, and ſometimes fetches tears from mine eyes, as particularly when Maſter <hi>M.</hi> ſaid, That afflictions were a teſtimony of Gods love to his people, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> was ſorely afflicted, and dearly
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:153892:43"/> beloved. 6. Since I heard Mr. <hi>B.</hi> and others, as alſo (ſuitable to my condition) ſevcral things laid open by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> in ſome caſes of Conſcience; I have been much affected to ſettle my ſelf ſo by the power of Chriſt, that I may find peace in my conſcience in all things before I dye, and have made it my chief buſineſs, and have found comfort in the meetings of godly people. 7. I bleſs the name of the Lord, my affections are loving to the people of God, and I know I love them dearly, and my heart riſeth to hear them ſpoken againſt; I had rather bear reproaches my ſelf, than than ſee any one of them wronged, or ſuffer. 8. I deſire as to live with God in glory in Heaven, ſo to lead my life to his glory here on Earth in grace, according to the rule of his holy Word, and the examples of the Saints therein expreſſed; and I could heartily wiſh, were it poſſible, that I might never ſin more. And I have I bleſs God a clear diſcerning, through the power of the Spirit of Grace, that the Goſpel is the Word of truth to Salvation. 9. When I come before the Lord, I ſee nothing but emptineſs in my ſelf, and therefore truſt in the fulneſs of Chriſt, in whoſe power and Spirit I find much comfort, and deſire always, that I may come prepared with that wedding garment that may never be taken away from me; <hi>for of my ſelf I can do nothing, but through Chriſt, if he abide in me, and I in him, I ſhall do all things.</hi> M.

               </head>
               <p>WHen I was in the midſt of my wealth, and worldly enjoyments, I was vain, covetous, and wholy had my heart taken up with the things of the World, little or nothing minding the things of God, or thinking of a change, but went on in preſumption, putting the evil day far off, minidng only for the preſent what pleaſed the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:153892:43"/> fleſh, untill about eight years ſince, I had many outward croſſes befell me, and was in ſome want; and then being under that diſpenſation, I was much troubled, and full of grief; I ſought to the Lord, and begged deliverance from my afflictions and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes, as to outward wants, but had not an heart to conſider what was the cauſe, or to ſeek out the mind of God in it, until I heard Dr. <hi>Holmes</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſin to be the cauſe of all our croſſes. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration hereof did come cloſe unto my ſpirit, and I had a clear conviction of my vanity, and fooliſh doting on worldly things, which had juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoked the Lord, I hope for my good, to lay thoſe croſſes upon me, which, though they were for a time bitter, yet God hath ſince ſweetned.</p>
               <p>But my ſorrow was then doubled, and I was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected, not only for my outward croſſes, but more eſpecially for my carnal heart, and vain converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whereby I had ſtirred up the anger of the Lord againſt me: I went to the Ordinances, hoping to find comfort from the Word; but the weight of my ſins, and my ſufferings ſo preſſed me down, that I found much heavineſs: My ſins eſpecially lay heavy upon me, and I ſaw little hope of comfort; yet the Lord was pleaſed to work in my heart a loathing of ſin, as well as trouble for the affliction it had brought upon me. But about a year ſince, I heard Maſter <hi>W.</hi> prove by Scripture, in a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon very effectual to my comfort, that thoſe who have been the greateſt of ſinners, if they do heartily and really repent, and turn to God by faith in Chriſt, and lead a new life, the Lord will receive them to mercy. Hereupon I argued with my Soul, that though I had been a great ſinner, yet the Lord had brought my heart to a loathing of thoſe ſins I loved; and of all ſins, and to turn to the Lord, and ſincerely to deſire to ſerve him: That
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:153892:44"/> therefore there was hope of mercy for me: I heard Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Mr. <hi>M.</hi> and others, and frequented divers meetings, where I found much comfort,</p>
               <p>Thoſe ſeveral places of Scripture, in which I chiefly found comfort from the Promiſes of God are, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28, 29, 30. where Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt. Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and ye ſhall find reſt unto your Souls; for my yoak is eaſie, and my burden light.</hi> This made me to hope, that as the Lord hath given me an heavy heart la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with the ſenſe of ſin, ſo Chriſt Jeſus will give me comfort; for in the 12 verſe of the ſame Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it is ſaid, <hi>a hruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and and ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench.</hi> And though I had diſhonoured Chriſt, yet I had not blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Holy-ghoſt, and therefore had incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to believe from the words of Chriſt, Luke 12.10. <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſpeak a word againſt the Son of Man, it ſhall be forgiven him, but unto him that Blaſphemeth againſt the Holy Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven.</hi> I was comforted to wait upon the Lord in hope, becauſe he had humbled my Soul, and opened mine eyes to ſee mercy offered to me, and this was ſtrengthend from that example, <hi>Lament.</hi> 30.20. to verſe 26. <hi>My Soul hath them ſtill in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, and is humbled in me. This I recall to mind, thereſore have I hope. It is the Lords mercy that we are not conſumed, becauſe his compaſſions fail not. They are new every morning: Great is thy faithfulneſs, the Lord is my portion, ſaith my Soul, therefore will I hope in him. The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the Soul that ſeeketh him.</hi> I was much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from hence to ſeek the Lord, and hope in his mercy.</p>
               <p>My conſcience told me, I was a great ſinner,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:153892:44"/> and deſerved death and Hell, but my hope was in God, and ſtrengthened from that promiſe, Ezek. 18.21, 22, 23. <hi>If the wicked will turn from his ſins, that he hath committed, and keep all my Statutes, and do that which is lawfull and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye; All his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, they ſhall not be mentioned unto him: In the righteouſneſs that he hath done he ſhall live. Have I any pleaſure at all that the wicked ſhall dye, ſaith the Lord God, and not that he ſhould turn from his ways and live?</hi> And the Lord was pleaſed to put into my ſpirit a very great reſolution to ſerve him for the time to come, and I praiſe my God, I have had ſince much joy in duties of Piety. and much ſweetneſs from the Word of God, and goldly Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters; I have no deſire to enjoy the pleaſures and vanities of the World, as I have done, but my heart now takes delight in God, and communion with his people; and the Lord hath given me an heart io diſcern a beauty, and deſirableneſs, in the ways of God, which are more joyful to me now, than ever ſin was formerly; and when I come at the Ordinances, I often find and feel ſuch heavenly refreſhments from the Lord upon my heart, that it makes me exceeding full of joy. There is ſuch a love upon my heart to God, that I dare not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offend him in any thing; I rejoyce to hear his name ſpoken of, and his glory exalted: And I find a very great affection drawn by the power of God from my heart to ſuch as ſeem to be his people. <hi>J.

               </head>
               <p>ABout nine years agoe at the Birth of a Child, I had very great temptations of deſtroying<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing my ſelf, and have had oftentimes a knife put into my hand to do it, ſo that I durſt not be left by my ſelf alone; and when I had conſidered what
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:153892:45"/> the cauſes might be, my Conſcience did hint moſt my neglecting of duties which I had many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to have performed, they being the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God. Thus I continued till two years agoe I buryed a Child, which was a very great trouble to me to part with, and then was I more fully convinced of ſin, which cauſed my burthen to be the greater, ſo that I could ſeldom have any other thoughts but of deſperation; but the Lord kept me by his great mercy, ſo that ſometimes I could pray with devotion, and diſcern the Lord to remove this great trouble from me; I did plainly find that thoſe great temptations were very much leſſened, which was a very great comfort unto my ſpirit; but yet this ſtill was upon me, that I could read the Promiſes, but I found none of them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to me; I could not ſay, God was mine, or had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him ſelf to me, in pardoning my ſins; yet this I had often thoughts of, that I would throw my ſelf upon Chriſt, and if I periſhed I periſhed; and ſince, I bleſs God, I have found ſome ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in ſeveral places of Scripture: As,</p>
               <p>Firſt, In Matth. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> And feeling ſuch a burthen then upon my Soul, I relyed upon that true reſt. Another is in 1 John 2.2. <hi>And he is the reconciliation for our ſins, and not for ours only, but for the ſins of the whole World. I</hi> being one in the World, I applyed this to my ſelf; and in 1 John 1 14. <hi>The Father ſent the Son to be the Saviour of the World.</hi> Another place of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is, John 3.17. <hi>For God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World through him might be ſaved.</hi> And in verſe 35. <hi>He that believeth on the Son hath everlaſting life.</hi> Upon this account I ſaid, <hi>I believe, Lord, help my unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</hi> And in the ſixth Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> and 67,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:153892:45"/> and 68, verſes, <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto his Diſcipes Will ye go from me alſo?</hi> Peter <hi>ſaid unto him, Lord, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall we go, for thou haſt the words of eternal life.</hi> So that I will now wait upon the Lord for a further manifeſtation of himſelf unto my Soul, in the uſe of his Ordinances; although I have not in times paſt been fed with the Childrens bread, yet now I do believe I ſhall not be denyed thoſe crums of Spiritual comforts, to nouriſh and refreſh my wearyed Spirit; for God ſaith, Iſa. 55.1. <hi>Ho! every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy and eat; yea, come buy Wine and Milk without money, and without price.</hi> And I praiſe God, I have found of late a very great manifeſtation of Gods working a change upon my heart, and drawing me by true faith to himſelf.</p>
               <p n="1">1. About a quarter of a year ſince, I heard Mr. <hi>B.</hi> on the luke-warmneſs of the Church of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> ſhewing that the Lord would refuſe none that come to him in humbleneſs of Spirit, and ſincerity of heart; then I thought ſurely I might make uſe of theſe full promiſes made to thoſe that come to him; and it put me to ſearch the Scriptures, which I did, and found a greater influence upon my ſpirit in the underſtanding of the Word than before. 2. I am in all things that I do, fearful of offending God, and my deſire is, to do all things to his glory. 3. My love to God is ſo hearty, that I delight to be medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating of God, and to have communion with him, and could wiſh that I might be wholly, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, with God; and my heart is never ſo at reſt, as when I am reading of his Truths, and hearing others ſpeak of them. 4. I am ſo little affected to the World, that I account it nothing; I can wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly leave all for God, and I hope ſuffer any thing for God, if he ſhould pleaſe to call me to it, ſo far as I can judge of my own heart, but herein truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:153892:46"/> in the power of Chriſt. 5. Sin is loathſom to me, ſo that the affections that I did bear to ſome evils are gone, and I now loath them more than before I loved them. 6. I have many conſticts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fleſh and the ſpirit, but I find (in thoſe ſtrivings) my heart moſt cleaving to follow the mind of God, knowing that if I give way to ſin, Satan enters; and with all my Soul I deſire and delight to follow the leadings of Gods Spirit. 7. In all things the reſolutions of my heart are for doing thoſe things that may pleaſe God, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay; being fearful to offend God, which through infirmity I do, I have great trouble in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for it; and my reſolutions aae always againſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that may hinder my peace with God. 8. I find in my heart ſo great a peace between God and my Conſcience, that ſhould God now call me, I ſhall be very well contented to go to my Saviour. 9. I do not doubt of Gods love to me, becauſe he hath drawn forth my heart ſincerely to love him. 10. My love hath been always from a Child to the people of God, and my heart hath been ever trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when I have heard them evil ſpoken of. 11. My affections are great to the Ordinances, and my heart longeth after them; and when at any time I come with a cold heart to Duties, yet my heart is frequently warmed, and inlarged in thoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. <hi>E.

                  <hi>XVIII.</hi> Experiences of <hi>D. M.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>SOme years ſince, through many croſſes increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon me, like an armed man, I flew un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God to ſeek his mind by prayer, and he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to me that it was for my ſins, which were then ſet before me; which cauſed m to feel the hand of God by afflictions upon me, that fin was the cauſe of my ſufferings, which lay very heavy upon me, and terrified me, ſo that I thought I had been in
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:153892:46"/> the way to damnation: And that if it had been in the way to Salvation, every affliction would not come ſo upon me, greater than I thought I could be able to bear. In particular, the Lord diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me, that I had too much loved my Husband in making an Idol of him, and therefore he juſtly became a great terror to my ſpirit, for he grew an enemy to goodneſs, and ſo an hindrance to me in coming to Chriſt; And while I thus doted on him, he went away from me: I feared, through the ſenſe of that and other ſins, together with the aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations of my afflictions, that God did not love me; Yet it ſtruck into my heart, that God did not ſtrike willingly, and therefore I endeavoured to ſee what was the mind of God in it, who had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away my Husband, Goods, and all from me; namely, that he had done it, that I ſhould not hang upon husks, but ſhould love him. And I found that I had loved the world too much, and ſet my heart too much upon theſe Creature-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and therefore the Lord took them away from me. This wrought upon me great troubles and deipair, ſo that I cryed till I was almoſt blind: And I had great fear and trembling upon me, that I could not pray, not hear with profit, but thought it was in vain for me to pray, whom God loved not, and whom I had ſo offended.</p>
               <p>About a quarter of a year after, I had a tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Satan to drown my ſelf in a Pond near <hi>Leeds</hi> in <hi>York-ſhire,</hi> weither the Devil led me, tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling me that I might do it there, it being a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate place where no body could ſee me; and I came to the Pond ſide, but by the providence of God, having a great love to a young Infant I had, I took that Child in my Arms, and when I came to the place, I looked upon the Child, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with my ſelf, what ſhall I deſtroy my ſelf
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:153892:47"/> and my poor Child? and cryed out unto God, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? and had a ſore conflict at that time with the Devil; but me thought at laſt, I heard the Lord ſay to my Soul, as he did to <hi>Paul, Truſt in me, my grace is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for thee.</hi> And then I found ſome comfort, which inlarged my heart, through the aſſiſtance of Gods Spirit, to call upon the name of the Lord, for further aſſiſtance and comfort, and ſo I went back again with much joy, believing that I ſhould have the favour of God. And the Lord put it into my mind to go to one <hi>E. B.</hi> that dwelt by a Moor ſide near <hi>Leeds,</hi> whom I knew was a godly Woman, and ſhe opened to me the troubles of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> and gave me ſweet comfort, ſaying, God was by me, and I did not ſee him, and as <hi>Job</hi> wiſhed, ſo ſhe wrought upon my heart to wiſh, <hi>O that I could ſee him, O that I could behold him,</hi> and my heart was full of joy, and I cryed, and was much grieved, with very great repentance that I had been ſo ſeduced, and did ſo deſpair of Gods mercies, and had been ſo blinded. And the Lord ſet it upon my ſpirit, that though I had laid all aſide, yet now I ſhould come out of the <hi>Wilderneſs lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on my Beloved;</hi> and I had a greater affection to the ways of God than ever, and delighted in them more than ever. Before they were a burthen to me; now they were eaſie and ſweet.</p>
               <p>Being at <hi>York,</hi> I heard a Miniſter there out of <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. preach that which wrought much comfort in me, and that Chriſt had promiſed to betroth himſelf to every Believer: And then, and ſince I have much joy in the promiſes of God, and can through the Spirit of God, which I find and feel in my heart, lay hold by faith on them, as my par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular intereſt. As Rom. 10.4. <hi>Chriſt is the end of the Law for righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:153892:47"/> Chriſt by hss Spirit hath wrought belief in me, both in his promiſes, and threatnings, and to live according to his Word, therefore I conclude, that I ſhall be ſaved by the righteouſneſs of my Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, Rom. 9.4. <hi>Who are Iſraelites? to whom per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the giving of the Law, and the ſervice of God and the promiſes?</hi> I know that every Believer is a true <hi>Iſraelite,</hi> and brought under the Covenant of grace by Jeſus Chriſt, and that therefore the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of grace and ſalvation belong to me, Rom. 3.21, 22. <hi>But now the righteouſneſs of God without the Law is manifeſted, being witneſſed by the Law and the Prophets, even the Righteouſneſs of God, which is by Faith of Jeſus unto all, and upon all them that believe, for there is no difference:</hi> I being one whom God hath drawn to believe, it is manifeſted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, that I have an intereſt in the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, to juſtifie me before God by his merits, which are made mine by faith, Hoſea 2.19, 20. <hi>I will betroth thee unto me ſor ever, yea I will betroth thee unto me in righteouſneſs, and in judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in loving kindneſs, and in mereies; I will even betroth thee unto me in ſaithſulneſs, and thou ſhalt know the Lord.</hi> I find great comfort from this promiſe, in that the Lord doubles and trebles his Promiſes, and enlargeth himſelf ſo freely to the Soul.</p>
               <p>And as teſtimonies of my real converſion to God, and union with Jeſus Chriſt, and that reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is made between God and my Soul, I find theſe real evidences wrought by Gods bleſſed Spirit in me. 1. I find in my heart great love to God, that when God ſaith, <hi>Seek my face;</hi> my heart rejoyns again, ſaying, <hi>thy face Lord will I ſeek.</hi> And I find nothing ſo dear to me as the love of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and if my heart deceive me not, I could bear and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:153892:48"/> any thing to bring glory to God, <hi>accounting all things but dung and droſs below Chriſt.</hi> 2. When any thing of the fleſh ariſeth againſt the motions of Gods Spirit to draw me from good, or to do evil, I find frequently the power of the Spirit to ſubdue my heart not to ſubmit to the fleſh, but to walk in his way, and yet I am ſo ſenſible of my infirmities, that all that I do, or can do is nothing, but as fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy rags; but I know Jeſus Chriſt is my Saviour, and ſtands engaged for me, and when the fleſh is weakeſt, I find the Spirit thirſteth after God. 3. I find in my heart a very great thirſting after the Ordinances, and a great enlargment of heart, and comfort in them, my heart being delighted to be among the people of God, and full of joy in them. 4. When thoughts of want at any time ariſe, I find full ſatisfaction in the better part, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can be taken from me, which is my intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt; And I find in my Conſcience a great teſtimony of my Spiritual union with God, and that I am ſo ſeparated from the world in my affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that God hath drawn me to himſelf. 5. God who ſearcheth the heart, knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit, becauſe he maketh interceſſion for the Saints according to the will of God, which will of God I find a free ſubmiſſion to in my heart with joy; knowing, <hi>that all things ſhall work to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for good to them that love God.</hi> 6. It is the chiefeſt deſire of my heart that God would keep me cloſe to my duty, and I have abundance of joy in communion with the Lord, which is more ſweet to me, than my joy in any thing elſe. 7. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light much to ſpeak of God, and of his ways, and to uſe what means I can to comfort the Saints, whom I love dearly, and if poſſible to convert ſinners.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Had lately great grief upon my ſpirit about a Daughter, which was brought to great ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and by reaſon of her going away in her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, I thought ſhe had made away her ſelf: God put it into my thoughts to remember my ſins; and that he had laid this affliction upon me, for neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting my duty to him, and not ſerving him as I ought. This cauſed great ſorrow in me, and made me abundantly ſhed tears, my ſins I thought were the occaſion that the Lord made her ſo great a croſs to me, for which I had deſerved it, ſo that both became a great grief to my Soul; and thus I lay languiſhing in very great ſorrow: Then I began to think with my ſelf that there is no refuge but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in Chriſt; and I conſulted my thoughts, how to go to good company and meetings, where I might find comfort from the people of God. And about two years ſince, one morning I came to Mr. <hi>S.</hi> to joyn with godly people that came thither to pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, though with a great deal of diſtraction in my mind; and I ſhewed my diſcontents and condition to him, and he told me, that if I had but a mind to ſeek God, and to repent, he was gracious, and would receive me to mercy: The thing that I did earneſtly beg of God was, to know Chriſt crucified for me, and he told me, that indeed was beſt of all: And after ſome good inſtructions from him and others, I was much delighted to frequent the meetings of Gods Servants, and good Sermons; and I found many good operations upon my heart After very ſtrong conflicts, whicn I had thus for about three quarters of a year, lying in my bed, waking all the night, and calling upon God to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect me to ask at his hands thoſe things which might be for his glory, and my comfort, and begging that he would give me a ſetled heart that might
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:153892:49"/> not be diſtracted with the things of the World. In the morning I fell tnto a ſlumber, with God ſtill in my thoughts, in which I heard as it were a voice from Heaven ſpeaking to my heart, and ſaying thus, <hi>Ask of God a perfect upright heart to walk in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence;</hi> which when I was fully awake, I took to be the motion of Gods Spirit upon my Conſcience, which did fill me with much joy, provoking me to pray to the Lord to grant me that grace.</p>
               <p>And about two years ſince, the Lord gave me a ſenſe of my ſins in a greater meaſure than before, and my repentance was more ſpiritual, and my ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſin more real. And I found a ſore com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate betwixt the fleſh and the ſpirit, being more ſenſible how I had ſtrayed from the rule of the Goſpel, and did yet come ſhort of my duty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and it was a great grief to my heart, that I could not live according to that which God had revealed of his will to me. Whilſt I was thus troubled in ſpirit, I heard ſome things in ſeveral Sermons preached by Maſter <hi>B.</hi> touching the ſins of our natural corruptions, and what holineſs God repuires of us. And I heard Mr. <hi>C.</hi> ſhew that we ſhould ſtrive to <hi>enter in at the narrow gate</hi> which wrought in my heart a very great ſenſe of my ſins.</p>
               <p>In theſe conflicts I met with many diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and Satan tempted me to, deſpair, but the Lord ſuſtained me. I conſidered that as a ſinner, I deſerved nothing but Damnation, but my comfort was in Chriſt, and my grief was interlaced with comforts: Sometimes I was in ſorrow two or three days, and then again found comfort, and often prayed unto the Lord to lay no more weight upon me, then he would give me ſtrength to bear, and I found the Lord to be my ſhield and buckler, and remembred many promiſes from the Lord, in which
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:153892:49"/> to this day, I bleſs God, I have, and ſtill do find much comfort. As Pſal. 34.19. <hi>Many are the afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Righteous, but the Lord delivereth him out of them all:</hi> I have had many afflictions for my ſins, but none but Chriſts righteouſneſs is my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, in whom I truſt for deliverance. Ezekiel 33.11. <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed turn from his evil way, and live; turn ye, turn ye, from your evil ways, for why will ye dye, O ye houſe of</hi> Iſrael, Matth. 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> Ezekiel 18.30. <hi>Repent and turn your ſelves from all your tranſgreſſions, ſo iniquity ſhall not be your ruine,</hi> Iſaiah 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he, that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for my own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe and divers other promiſes, I praiſe God, I have had comfort from, and as the fruits of my faith, and my love to God, I have theſe Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces wrought by his Spirit through faith in my heart, as a further manifeſtation of my intereſt in Chriſt. 1. I believe in the Promiſes of the free mercies of God, in the merits of Chriſt, and can apply them with comfort to my own Soul, as mine by faith. 2. My heart and my mind affects God above all the pleaſures and joys in the World, and when I think of the things of the World in relation to God, I think that without God all is but vain and vanity. 3. When I think of my croſſes and afflictions in the World, then I lift up my heart to God in Chriſt, and can ſay, <hi>Having thee, I have all things; if I have Chriſt, I have enough.</hi> 4. My heart rejoyces in duties, and my Soul doth more rejoyce in hearing the Word, than in worldly pleaſures. 5. I have the peace of God upon my conſcience, which is more to me than all things in the world, and
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:153892:50"/> makes me ſet the world at naught, and it is my prayer, that I may never be without that peace of God whatever befalls me. 6. The Lord hath giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me a contented mind in what condition ſoever he brings me to, and his Spirit worketh upon my heart, that I do not repine againſt his will. <hi>E. L.</hi>

               <p>SOme time agoe a Child of mine about ſix years of age, when I have bid him go forth to play, he hath come in again very ſolitary, becauſe other Children would ſwear and be rude, I would ask him, <hi>Robert,</hi> what aileth you, why do you not go to play? he would anſwer, That he had no fellows to play withal, but ſuch as would ſwear, and the like, and they cannot be (ſaid he) Gods children. I would ſay, why not Child? then he would ſay, No Mother, though I am but a little way in my Book, yet I have learnt, that God will not pardon ſuch ſins as ſwearing; I have ſometimes ſaid, Yes Child, I hope God will pardon them, elſe God help thy Father, and God help us all: Then he hath replyed, Mother, with great repentance God can forgive, for his mercies are great; but good Mother, let us forbear that which is evil. And many times I had ſuch conference with that Child, that ſeeing me troubled about it, he hath ſaid, Good Mother be content, their Parents are ſuch, and they muſt needs learn after them.</p>
               <p>I thought upon my Childs words, and having before often offended God on the Lords Days, and the thoughts of other failings in my converſation, it wrought great trouble upon my heart, ſo that I was much afflicted in Soul, conſidering that my Child ſo young, ſhould give me ſuch inſtructions, which hath proved a bleſſing to bring me home to him; I did then make ſome doubt whether God would forgive me thoſe ſins, and about that time
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:153892:50"/> hearing Dr. <hi>

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſher, That the Lord is the ſhield and defence of thoſe that truſt in him,</hi> I had ſome comfortable hopes in the Lords mercies; but I found many doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings ſtill; yet about ſeven years ſince, Maſter <hi>Tomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> made a Sermon at <hi>Liverpoole,</hi> then beſieged, ſhewing, <hi>That we muſt lay hold on the Lord, and hold faſt, and he will lead us through all Troubles;</hi> and ſoon after it was loſt, and many were killed, but I bleſs God I had no hurt at all, which did much comfort me that the Lord of his mercy had delivered me; I did, and ſtill do hope, that the Lord had a mind to ſave me, and to draw me nearer to himſelf; which together with ſome other delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances of the Lords great mercy, I took great comfort in, ſo that when I had ſcarce bread and water, (and I have been ſtreightned ſince) yet I found ſtill comfort from the Lord for my ſelf, and to be an inſtrument to help others, who were priſoners.</p>
               <p>And the Lord then, and ſince hath by his Spirit comforted me with ſeveral Promiſes, which I praiſe God I can apply to my ſelf, by which I have a teſtimony of my true belief, ſome of which are theſe which follow, Gen. 15.1. <hi>The Word of the Lord came unto</hi> Abraham <hi>in a viſion, ſaying, Fear not,</hi> Abraham, <hi>I am thy ſhield, and thy exceeding great reward.</hi> I had found the Lord to be my ſhield in thoſe many deliverances he had wrought
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:153892:51"/> for me, and had taken away that diſtruſtful fear, which before was upon me, and therefore I was, and ſtill am confident he will be my exceeding great reward, Pſal. 119.57. <hi>Thou art my portion, O Lord, I have ſaid that I would keep thy words.</hi> The ſame God wrought in my heart, to ſay with <hi>David,</hi> that I would keep thy Word, O Lord; and tho I cannot as I ſhould, yet my deſire is to keep it, my mind is to keep it; therefore I preſume with <hi>David</hi> to ſay, <hi>Thou art my portion, O Lord.</hi> John 15.5. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the Vine, ye are the Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, he that abideth in me, and I in him, the ſame bringeth forth much fruit, for without me ye can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</hi> I know my ſelf to be nothing without Chriſt, and though I have infirmities, yet my heart abides in Chriſt. And therefore I hope to find righteouſneſs; and ſalvation not in my ſelf, but in Chriſt, deſiring alſo that I may bring forth fruit as a branch in him, Rom. 8.1. <hi>There is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now no condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit:</hi> I find my ſelf to be one of thoſe, who walk in my heart in the ways of God, to which I am led by his Spirit, and not after the fleſh, and though I cannot ſerve God ſo well as I would, I do as well as I can; and am troubled in my ſpirit for my failings, and therefore I believe I ſhall never be condemned.</p>
               <p>And I have theſe teſtimonies of my converſion, and ſincere love to God, as the fruits of my faith, 1. The Lord hath by his Spirit manifeſted to my Soul, that the <hi>Wiſdom of the Spirit is life and peace,</hi> and hath wrought that peace in my heart, that I do not deſire any way to break from it, for any other enjoyments whatſoever. 2. This I deſire to be built upon, that I may find Chriſt to be my life and peace. 3. I find that the Lord hath great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:153892:51"/> wrought upon me, and my mind is fully affected with the Lord, out of whom I do not care for any thing that is in the World. 4. My deſire is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſerve God, and leave all things in the World as vain trifles for the enjoyment of him. 5. My love is ſo much to God in Chriſt, that having him, I know I have all things, and without him I have nothing. 6. I find that I have great comfort, and am much refreſhed by Ordinances, a ſenſe of the Spirit is frequently brought upon my heart, and I have received a great deal of comfort therein, when I have been weak; and it hath been a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing to me, when food hath been ſcant. And particularly, from ſeveral Sermons preached by Mr. <hi>Whitaker,</hi> Mr. <hi>Marſhal,</hi> Mr. <hi>Carter,</hi> and others, as alſo Mr. <hi>P.</hi> Dr. <hi>Homes,</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and at other meetings of godly people. 7. I find that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of the Ordinances are more ſweet to me, than all the pleaſures, riches, or friends in the world; for they are contenting comforts, and ſo are not worldly things. 8. I could find in my heart wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to dye, and leave Children, Brothers, Siſters, and all the World beſides to go to my Chriſt. <hi>J.B.</hi>

               <p>WHen it pleaſed God to call my Husband from me, I was for a time as exceedingly caſt down, and troubled, as I think any poor creature could be; in which I was ſo overwhelmed, that I did not know which way to turn my ſelf, nor what to do, yet was ſeeking the Lord, to find out what was his mind in the thing: I had loſt a good eſtate, had no body to look after my buſineſs, had many injured me, and had loſt above the reſt a pious Husband, whom I intirely loved, yet the Lord put it into my heart, that all this was to wean me from my ſins, and too much doting upon
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:153892:52"/> an Husband, and other worldly enjoyments, which my heart was too much taken up with, therefore the Lord was pleaſed to ſtrip me of them in a great meaſure, to bring me nearer to himſelf. I went to divers places to hear ſeveral Miniſters, and by waiting upon the Ordinances to ſeek after the Lord, if poſſible I might find comfort and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to my Soul herein; but continued in much affliction upon my ſpirit, for near a years time; at laſt I heard Maſter <hi>Jenkins</hi> preaching out of the 21. Chapter of <hi>John</hi> the 18. and 19. verſes, <hi>Verily, Verily, I ſay unto thee, when thou waſt young, thou girdedſt thy ſelf, and walkedſt whether thou wouldeſt; but when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thy hands, and another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldeſt not. This ſpake he, ſignifying by what death he ſhould glorifie God.</hi> The conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of which diſpenſation from God to him, drew forth my heart to be contented with what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever the Lord ſhould be pleaſed to lay upon me: And I was ſatisfied to ſuffer or bear any thing, in that it was the Lords will to glorifie himſelf, by ſuch diſpenſations towards the Saints. And the Lord hath ſince made me as he did <hi>David,</hi> to be contented as well with <hi>his Rod, as with his ſtaff;</hi> and then, and ſince, I praiſe the Lord, I can ſay with <hi>David, It was well for me that I was afflicted.</hi> I was comforted with that example of ahe woman in the Goſpel, to whom it was ſaid by Chriſt, <hi>that it is not lawful to take the childrens bread, and caſt it to dogs,</hi> in that I could ſay with her, <hi>Truth Lord, but the dogs may lick the crums that fall from their Maſters Table;</hi> I remembred Gods diſpenſations towards <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and reſolved with <hi>Joſhua, that I and my houſe wold ſerve the Lord.</hi> And although it was a bitter pill to me to bear the croſs before, yet now my God hath made it eaſie; and I praiſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:153892:52"/> the Lord, through his grace, I can go under it with a great deal of comfort; and he hath now diſcovered to me the way of his working in thoſe things, which before were wonderful ſtrange to me.</p>
               <p>Many ſpecial promiſes I found great comfort in, ſome that I remember are theſe that follow, <hi>(viz.)</hi> 1 Pet. 5.6, 7. <hi>Humble your ſelves therefore, under the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time. Caſting all your care on him, for he careth for you.</hi> This promiſe I have found of a truth made good to me in ſome meaſure, I have applyed it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, and have found the comfort of it, 2 Cor. 1.29. <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee.</hi> From this place I found much comfort, knowing the fulneſs of ſo glorious a portion, Jam. 1.2, 3, 4. <hi>Count it all joy, when ye fall into divers temptations, knowing this, that the tryal of your faith worketh patience But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect and intire, wanting nothing;</hi> This admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred great joy to me againſt all temptations, Iſa. 55.1. Ho! <hi>every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters of life, and he that hath no mony, come ye, buy and eat.</hi> This gave great comfort to my Soul at ſeveral times, though it was ſo much caſt down.</p>
               <p>And that which gives me great content and comfort is, the ſeal of Gods Spirit in my heart, giving evidence of peace in the blood of Chriſt, between God and my Soul, by theſe teſtimonies. 1. My love to God is ſo, that I am confident (if the Lord keep me with his Spirit, which at this time he hath beſtowed upon me) I could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to part with any thing, or lay down my life for his glory, if he would call me to it. 2. The Lord hath been pleaſed ſo to inrich my Soul with his Spirit, that I loath the things of the World,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:153892:53"/> when they would draw me in any thing, from ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the motions of Gods Spirit in my heart: I once thought nothing could have drawn me from the love of the vain things of the world, but now I do as much diſdain them for God, and more than then I loved them. 3. I deſire to follow Gods Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, and find great enlargments of my heart to God, both to, and in the Ordinances: And particularly from Mr. <hi>S.</hi> Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and others, from whom many things have fallen that have much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed my Soul, and I find my heart in duties to God, more refreſhed than in any thing. 4. I find much peace in my conſcience, becauſe of a free ſubmiſſion which his Spirit hath wrought in my Soul to all the commands of Jeſus Chriſt; and I find comfort in that true circumciſion which is in my heart, wrought by his Spirit. 5. I find every every day ſo great a peace in my Soul, and ſuch comfort in God, that I could be willing, and I bleſs God, find in my ſelf a readineſs to dye every moment.</p>

               </head>
               <p>ABout two years ſince, my Husband was ſore wounded, which I took as a great tryal, not having above a month to go with Child, and I was troubled at it: And about a quarter of a year after I was up, all my Children were ſick together of the ſmall Pox. Yet all this did not work upon me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly ſo ſenſibly as about a month afterwards that one of my Children dyed ſuddenly, when I thought he had been near well, then I ſaid, the <hi>wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of ſin is death,</hi> thinking that the Lord had warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me by Fatherly threatnings before, but I did not hearken to him, and therefore I thought he ſmote me now, by the death of my Child. But yet I could not enter into any particular ſins that God ſhould ſtrike at, only in general, I ſought
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:153892:53"/> the Lord to lay open my ſins to me; I was very much troubled, that the Lord took my child ſo ſuddenly from me, but was comforted by Mr. <hi>Strong,</hi> in ſome Sermons preached from the words the Church to <hi>Paul,</hi> going to ſuffer at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Acts 21.14. <hi>When he would not be perſwaded, we ceaſed, ſaying, The will of the Lord be done.</hi> So I was ſetled pretty well in my thoughts, till ſuddenly the Lord ſtruck the elder of my two Children then living, which was a Boy, my other, which is a Girl, I did not ſo much value, but now I do, and know Gods mercy in ſparing her, but my Child that then dyed was the chief comfort that my heart was fixed upon in this world, which was ſo great a grief to me, that I have ſlept few nights quiet, I deſired to know the mind of God, what he would do with me; Sometimes I ſhould have difpaired through great buffetings inwardly, but that the Lord ſuſtained me. Sometimes I thought that the wrath of God was kindled againſt me, thinking never to have comfort in this world again. But bleſſed be the Lord for it, he hath often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted me in this, that I have thought he did it in love to me; yet ſometimes I have feared that I ſhould deſpair, and that the hand of God was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me in it, having been troubled with thoughts, that I was the death of my children.</p>
               <p>Thus I have been between hope and diſpair, and could not find what the Will of God was in it to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards me: And I had fears that the hand of God was ſtill againſt me, for further puniſhment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I have had many temptations upon me, in low thoughts of God. But I have gone to prayer, and deſired the Lord to deliver me, and diſcover his mind to me, in every thing that I do, and have found a willingneſs to part with any thing, even to cut off a limb, or any thing if I could find
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:153892:54"/> out, what it was: And I bleſs God I have found a good ſpirit reſiſting the bad. Yet I have been under much fear, that I was not a child of God. But it hath pleaſed God to comfort me in this, that <hi>Pauls</hi> life was ſubject to temptations, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had hope and caſt my ſelf upon the mercies of God, reſolving that if I <hi>periſh, I periſh,</hi> never daring to offend willingly in any thing, that I know to be a ſin; yet I know I am a wretched ſinner, but I humbly deſire to do the will of God, ſo far as I am able. And in that I can ſay with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 42.1. <hi>As the heart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo panteth my ſoul after thee, O God.</hi> I find comfort with him to ſay, <hi>Why art thou caſt down, O my Soul? and why art thou diſquieted within me? hope thou in God, for I ſhall yet praiſe him, for the help of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,</hi> verſe 5. And <hi>I will look unto the Lord,</hi> with the Prophet <hi>Micha, I will wait for the God of my Salvation, my God will hear me,</hi> Mich. 7.7. And I have found much comfort in applying ſeveral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes to my Soul. As <hi>Matth.</hi> 5.4. Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Bleſſed are they that mourn, for they ſhall be comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> As God hath given me a mourning Spirit for my ſins, ſo I believe that in his time I ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted, and I have taſted I bleſs God, of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of his Spirit in my Soul. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 55.1. The Lord ſaith, <hi>Ho! every one that thirſteth come ye to the waters; and he that hath no mony, come ye, buy, and eat, yea, come, buy wine and milk without mony, and without price.</hi> As the Lord hath made my Soul to thirſt for him, ſo I doubt not but to find him. And the Lord ſays, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed turn from his way, and live;</hi> I thank God, my heart and ſoul is turned from all things, and is only after the Lord. And in a ſpecial manner, I have found ſweet evidences of my faith and intereſt in
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:153892:54"/> God through Chriſt; I had lately much comfort from a Sermon preached by Mr. <hi>Strong,</hi> who ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that afflictions did not make us low in the ſight of God, though before men; as alſo from the words at a conference by Mr. <hi>V. That in the World we ſhall have tribulations; but in God reſt.</hi> And 1. I do clearly find that my love is more ſet upon God than upon any thing. 2. I could more willingly leave the world now, than ever before, and I could willingly dye, if God ſaw it good, in the mind I am. 3. I find in my heart that I do ſo caſt my ſelf upon God, that I have peace with him. 4. In times of doubtings, I find comfort that I have a God to call upon and I find much peace in my mind in returns from God. 5. I do always find when any evil thoughts ariſe, a power from God which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues them, ſo that I never willingly give way to them. 6. I find my affections ready to go forth both to duties, and in duties to God; and when I come to them with little affection, yet I bleſs God I find a great deal of comfort uſually before I go away. 7. I find the moſt comfort to my ſpirit is, when I am weeping for my infirmities, or at prayer, or duties, in publick or private, and methinks I find ſuch joy in them, that I could dwell there, having no comfort in the world like that. 8. I find in my heart a real love to all if any have wronged me, I de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſire no revenge, but that I may be at peace with all.</p>

               <p>ABout 16. years of Age, though I did not under<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtand the Word, yet I had a great deſire to go to hear, becauſe they ſerved God therin that did ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> knowing that there is a God that ought to be ſerved.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:153892:55"/> And I ſat in corners ſtudying what way I might come to God if I ſhould dye; having a very grear affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction wrought by the Lord upon my ſpirit; praying as well as I could, that my ſelf, and my Father, and Mother, and Friends, might go to God when we dye. And I was very much ſet upon duties, thinking to find God there; but afterwards lived in a Family, where I was much hindred from the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, or partaking of any thing of God, which was a great grief unto me. Yet ſometimes I had thoughts towards worldly things, pondering how to be rich, or fine as others, but God wrought in my heart a remorſe to check thoſe temptations. And frequently the Lord laid ſome affliction or other upon me to wean me the more from ſuch vain thoughts, which brought my heart into a very ſad condition many times; and ſometimes I have wept day and night; And at other times, through grief that I could not ſorrow enough, I have fallen into a great meaſure of weeping.</p>
               <p>After, I had lived in ſeveral other Families, where I had little comfort; About twenty years ſince, hearing Mr. <hi>F.</hi> and Mr. <hi>P.</hi> on Lords-days, I was much comforted, and alſo by Mr. <hi>Marſhall,</hi> and others: and from the conſideration of the Love of God in Chriſt, and the ſufferings of Chriſt for us, as alſo of the Woman that did but by Faith touch the hem of Chriſts garment, how ſhe was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted and healed, and I had much comfort in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate meetings. But about five years ſince, ſeeing my other Neighbours many of them flouriſh and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in the World more than I, I began to doubt that I did but play the Hypocrite, and that perhaps they did pray more at home than I, though I knew ſome of them went leſs to the publick Ordinances, I was very much troubled at this, and thought with my ſelf, Lord, ſhall I ſtill lye at the Pool, and find
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:153892:55"/> no body to put me in, that I may be healed? and I was much troubled becauſe many of my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours hated me for frequenting private meetings. And for above a month I ſpent much time in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate prayer, and often in the night upon my Bed, and went to hear only on the Lords-days. But then I had thoughts upon me, that it was not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to God to pray unto him upon a ſoft Bed. Then the Lord put it in my heart, that he had promiſed, <hi>That where two or three are met together in my name, that I will be in the midſt of them:</hi> This cauſed me to go again, as I had done before, to hearing of Sermons on week-days. But ſtill I found many reaſonings and doubtings upon my ſpirit, whether I was elected or not, and was much caſt down many times about it, and had ſome tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to deſpair, fearing that ſuch a ſinner as I, could not be ſaved. Yet I had comfort in this, that though I was a ſinner, God by his Spirit had mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified me. And though I am not ſo good as I ſhould be, yet through the power of grace, I am not ſo bad as the fleſh would be; and finding much of the teſtimony of Gods Spirit upon my heart, I had great hope that I had marks and tokens of my believing.</p>
               <p>One night (having for about half a years time before uſed to go to Bed before I prayed) being in Bed, and thinking to pray to God, I had ſtrange temptations upon me, to put God out of my mind, and I could not ſpeak a word, nor ſcarce think of God, and if <hi>I</hi> did in ſome intervals, I could not name God, or Chriſt, nor ſpeak a word to God for the preſent. And Satan then ſeemed to appear to me in a moſt ugly ſhape, laughing and jeering at me, which did much affright me, and I feared that I had played the Hypocrite with God, and now ſhould run mad, to make good what ſome ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <pb n="94" facs="tcp:153892:56"/> reproachfully caſt upon me, that I was an Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite and I was riſing out of my Bed, but it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Lord to put it into my mind, that Chriſt Jeſus hath not given ſo much for Souls, as he hath done, to let the Devil have them for nothing. And in the ſtrength of the Lord I repulſed the Devil, ſaying, <q>Satan, when thou in tempting Chriſt ſhewedſt him the whole World, thou promiſedſt him that which was none of thine own; nor am I thine, and therefore avoid Satan, for thou haſt nothing to do with me, and then the Devil de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted from me.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then my heart was much filled with the thoughts of the goodneſs of God, and with a mixture of tears and joy, I had ſweet comforts from the Lord. And though I have had many doubts upon my ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit ſometimes, yet I have ſince found very great conſolation through Faith in the promiſes of God, as in theſe, and divers others, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour, and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt.</hi> I thank God I have found much reſt and refreſhment by coming to Chriſt, and that <hi>his grace is ſufficient for me.</hi> Matth. 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> I have often laid hold on this promiſe with a thirſting deſire after Jeſus Chriſt, and he hath filled me with comfort, And the comfort wherewith Chriſt did comfort <hi>Peter,</hi> bidding him not to <hi>fear, for he had prayed for him,</hi> hath been upon my ſpirit, and given me great conſolation, in that I know Chriſt is heard in all that he prayeth to the Father. And I find the Teſtimonies of my Converſion to God, which give ſatisfaction to my Soul, that I am a true Believer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Though I do all that I can to ſerve God, as he hath commanded me, yet I find great imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and utter unworthineſs in my ſelf to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve

I do find that the Love of God in Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains me to love God again, above all things in the World, and whatever I am about, my Soul is delighted with God above all. 3. I find that the Lord draws my heart to hate all evil communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and evil things, and not ſo much to fear the puniſhment of the World for any thing, as to ſin againſt God. 4. I am much delighted in the workings of Gods Spirit, and it is a great joy and comfort to my Soul, when my heart is inlarged towards God. 5. My heart is much affected un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Ordinances and if Satan ſuggeſted worldly thoughts to hinder me from duties, I have called upon God, and found comfort, and when I have come to duties with cold affections, I have been much refreſhed in the duties, &amp; though ſometimes I have felt pain and diſtemper in my body, which I have thought Satan hath done to make me weary in duties, yet I have called on the Lord, and found comfort. 6. I find great peace and much comfort in the Lord, ſo that I could be willing to dye, and it is a great joy to me, in that I expect to dye, that I may be delivered from the afflictions of the World, to enter into eternal joy with Chriſt for ever. <hi>E.

               <p>Several Miniſters and godly People uſed great means to comfort me, but all in vain for a time; and when I read the Scriptures, I found every threatning and judgment therein, that I fixed my thoughts upon, to ſpeak terrour to my Soul; and my diſtraction was ſo great, that my Friends ſaid I was mad, and kept the Bible from me. For ſo often as I read in it, I pored moſt upon that dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.31. <hi>All manner of ſin and blaſphemy ſhall be forgiven unto men, but the blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall not be forgiven unto men.</hi> I did not know what the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt was, but I had a perſwaſion I had committed that ſin, and feared that my ſins could not be pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that I ſhould never go to Heaven, but was caſt off to the damned. Yet this the Lord wrought for me, and in me, by his bleſſed Spirit, to draw forth my heart to be often praying in that poor doubting way my ſpirit could, by the Lords aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance vouchſafed to me, attain unto; for though I thought it in vain, and that God would not hear me, yet I continued praying, and often cryed to God, not only in the day time, but frequently in the night, and riſe out of my Bed to pray to God to have mercy upon me. And I was ſometimes a little comforted, in that I was perſwaded to hope in the Lord, but yet it was daſhed again through fear that I had committed the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.

               </head>
               <p>I Have many times had a deſire to hear the Word of God, when imployed about my Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; But I then thought to my ſelf, that I had no body to provide for me, but if God would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow on me ſo much of theſe outward things, as upon others in the World, then I would ſpend more time in hearing, praying, and reading the Word. And accordingly, as rheſe outward things have ebbed or flowed, ſo hath my joy been leſs or more. But now God hath given me a ſight of my ſins, and why I had formerly no comfort, it was becauſe I had not faith in my heart. Before God wrought that in me, inſtead of making uſe of thoſe comforts which the Word holds forth, I ſpent my time in miſtruſting Gods providence, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore juſtly during that time, held the ſence of his ſpiritual conſolations from me. Sometimes I was in deſpair (ſo low) that I could not apprehend any thing to be my portion but Hell. Every thing that fell not out according to my mind, I thought was a Judgment from God upon me. Yet I after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards got comfort by theſe inviting promiſes, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.1. <hi>Ho! every one that thirſteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath no money, come ye, buy, and eat, yea, come buy wine and milk without money, and without price.</hi> And <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from bis way <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nd live: Turn ye, turn ye from you evil ways, for why will ye die, O houſe of</hi> Iſrael?</p>
               <p>I had ſome comfort from theſe promiſes, but
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:153892:60"/> no aſſurance, my thoughts were various, and tho' between hope and deſpair, yet I reſolved to go to God, knowing that he is unchangeable, and that whom he <hi>loves, he loves to the end, and that if a ſinner doth repent and turn to him, he will blot all his ſins and iniquities out of his remembrance.</hi> And it pleaſed God to bring this promiſe into my mind, and to help me by faith to lay hold on it, and apply it to my ſelf, Ezek. 18.21, 22. <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my ſtatutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye: All his tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions that he hath committed, they ſhall not be mentioned unto him; in his righteouſneſs that he hath done he ſhall live.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, Job. 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> And this is life eternal, to know God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent.</p>
               <p>I bleſs God he hath made me now to believe, not only in word, but to labour to bring forth the fruits thereof in a godly life and converſation. 2. I cannot but admire the free love of God to me, that though I have given ear formerly to the Devil, and to the world, and to my own wicked heart; yet God hath been thus pleaſed now to call me out of darkneſs into his moſt marvellous light. 3. God hath been pleaſed to give me faith to believe, that though ſin hath abounded in me, yet grace ſhall now much more abound; This makes me to ſee the free love of God without any deſert in the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. 4. I have formerly gone about to limit God, and to be upon tearms with him, that if he would give me ſo much of theſe worldly things as I thought needful, then I would ſpend more time in thoſe duties which he hath commanded me. But this is
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:153892:61"/> contrary to the Word of God, which teacheth me now, <hi>Firſt, to ſeek the Kingdom of God, and the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs thereof, knowing that all other things ſhall be added to me that I want.</hi> 5. And now bleſſed be God, he hath made me to believe this, and all other promiſes, ſo that I can by faith call God my Father, who hath promiſed me that <hi>All things ſhall work together for good to me,</hi> becauſe I love him. 6. I have found ſomething from God, of hope of mercy, ſince I was a faithful hearer of the word; though the Devil did before tempt me with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to drive me to deſpair for ſin. 7. I am now, I praiſe my God, comforted, in believing that God will not mention my ſins againſt me, Chriſt dyed for ſinners, and the ungodly; and I know that although I have been a great ſinner, yet this hinders me not from laying hold on the promiſes. 8. I do believe, that the <hi>Life I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God;</hi> I ſee by faith, that Chriſt hath ſatisfied Gods juſtice for my ſins in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, and hath bid me to reckon my ſelf in him. 9. Now being ſpiritually marryed to Chriſt, all the priviledges of Saints and believers belong to me. And I can ſay, <hi>All is mine, and I am Chriſts, and Chriſt is Gods; Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods Elect? It is God that hath juſtified me, Who is he that ſhall condemn me? being now juſtified by Faith in Chriſt, I have peace with God.</hi> 10. I know when this earthly Tabernacle <hi>is diſſolved, I ſhall have an abiding not made with hands, but eternal in the Heavens;</hi> for Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am gone to prepare a place for you,</hi> that is, for me, and all Believers. 10. All the promiſes of God in Chriſt, are ſpoken to believers, and by faith I believe they are made to me, and becauſe he lives, I ſhall live alſo; Now Chriſt <hi>hath made me free, I am free indeed.</hi> 11. Chriſt hath done all for me, only bids me to
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:153892:61"/> believe, which faith by his Spirit he hath wrought in me. 12. I have formerly been ſtirred up to hear, pray, and read upon ſelfiſh conſideration of fear, that otherwiſe I ſhould go to Hell. And I am aſhamed to think how I have choſen rather to believe what the Devil hath ſaid, than what God hath ſaid. But bleſſed be the Lord, I now ſee it is free love that he forgiveth iniquity, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, and ſins, only becauſe mercy pleaſeth him; all that I can do cannot. 13. I am guilty before Gods juſtice in my ſelf, both by original ſin which came by the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and much more by thoſe many actual ſins, which I have perſonally committed, but I am juſtified by Chriſt. 14. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to ſhew my dutiful love in obedience to my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers commands, and my affections according to the rule of the Goſpel to Chriſt my Husband, with whom I am ſpiritually marryed. 15. The Lord ſaith, <hi>Come out from amongſt them all ye my people; and be ye ſeparated, and touch no unclean thing, and I will be your God, and ye ſhall be my people. And if I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear my prayers.</hi> I take God to witneſs, who knows the ſecrets of all hearts, that I deſire to joyn in duties, not to the end that others ſhould have a good opinion of me: I know I muſt leave all worldly relations, how ſoon I know not; but herein, I ſhall have peace, that I do as my Father hath commanded me; and I rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus, put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting no confidence in the fleſh, but only in the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of my Saviour. <hi>M. M.</hi>

                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>e curſe by nature, yet ſo, that I did withal ſee enough in
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:153892:62"/> Chriſt to deliver me from all, if I did attain to a true belief. But my perplexed Soul drank deep of the bitter dreggs of a ſorrowful cup, before I could taſt of the ſweet cordials my bleſſed Saviour had prepared for me, wherewith I have ſince been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten refreſhed. My conſcience told me, that if I ever expected deliverance from ſin, death, and hell, and to have favour with God, I muſt devote my heart to him alone. But yet I found the love of ſome worldly vanities rooted ſo faſt in my af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, that I did often put God off, and had an eye to ſome worldly contents, which deprived me (for that time) of enjoying peace in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. <q>I often ſaid, Lord, ſuch a day I will leave all, and never ſeek my ſelf, but thy glory in all things; and then again, Lord, after ſuch a merry meeting, then I will ſhake hands with all tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral delights; and again, now Lord once more, I will have but one day of pleaſure, and then I will part with all that offends thee, and not ſeek after any thing out of thee more.</q> But for a time all this proved but unfaithfulneſs to my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, and wounds to my own Spirit, the ſenſe whereof did ſadly terrifie my conſcience. My Soul was much caſt down, and I ſat up a great part of many nights, when all the Family, where I then lived, was in bed, and with an heavy heart, and floods of tears guſhing from my ſorrowful eyes, I was exceedingly diſquieted, pouring forth mine heart to my God, and begging mercy at the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtool of the Throne of grace.</p>
               <p>And that which was the greateſt horror upon my Spirit was, that I could not manifeſt my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving by a pious ſpiritual converſation in a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obedience, according to the ſacred rule of the Goſpel. When I have had reſolutions for worldly pleaſures to ſatisfie the deſires of nature, it hath
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:153892:62"/> taken away the comfort of my heart from ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al duties in the interim. But I found in my Soul a great conffict in wraſtling againſt thoſe ſad temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, my conſcience convincing me how great an enemy I was to my Soul therein, and teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it would be infinitely better to leave all the vain things of the world, than to live without the love of my Saviour. But when my God was pleaſed to bring my heart to a frame to reſolve ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly never to delay with God a moment more, my heart was ſo fixed on my Saviour, that I ſaw a ſufficiency in him under any diſpenſation: I taſted a greater ſweetneſs in the graces of his Spirit, than in any temporal pleaſure. And I found much of the love, grace, ſpirit, and power of my dear Saviour appearing to refreſh my troubled Soul.</p>
               <p>And I have found much comfort from divers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of the Lord, and particularly, Iſa. 49.8, 8. <hi>I will preſerve thee, and give thee for a Covenant of the people to eſtabliſh the earth, and to cauſe to inherit the deſolate heritages. That thou mayeſt ſay to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, go forth, to them that are in darkneſs, ſhew your ſelves.</hi> Though I was before a Priſoner to worldly vanities, and ſhut up in darkneſs, yet Chriſt being ſent to declare the Covenant to ſuch, I found good warrant to apply it to my ſelf, Ezek. 34.22. <hi>Therefore will I ſave my flock and they ſhall be no more a prey:</hi> This Salvation, I applyed as promiſed to me, conſidering, that though I was a ſinful man, yet it was my comfort that the Lord was my God; verſ. 31. <hi>And ye my flock, the flock of my paſture, are men, and I am your God,</hi> Mat. 5.6. <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled.</hi> God having given me an heart to hunger and thirſt after my Saviour and my God above all things, I believe this promiſe was made to me, with many more, which
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:153892:63"/> gave much ſweet comfort and conſolation to my Soul.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And being juſtified by faith, I have peace with God,</hi> through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the teſtimony of which faith is ſealed to my Soul by his bleſſed Spirit in theſe Demonſtrations. 1. I find many evident teſtimonies of the love of God to me, which hath drawn forth my Soul to an high eſteem of him, and to love him above all things. 2. I ſee nothing but ſin in my ſelf, and my truſt is in my Saviours merits for juſtification. 3. I feel glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous refreſhments from the heavenly gales of Gods bleſſed Spirit, breathing his grace into my Soul, which is the higheſt bliſs I can deſire on this ſide Heaven. 4. I find much comfort from the Word and Ordinances. 5. My chief deſire in all thsngs is to glorifie God. 6. I find a very great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in my heart to the people of God, or any that I judge ſo to be. 7. I deſire to be at peace with, and do all the good I can to all, eſpecially <hi>thoſe of the houſhold of Faith.</hi> 8. I can heartily beg of the Lord to give me deliverance from, and ſtrength againſt every ſin, though never ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to my nature, or which I am moſt prone to. 9. I find no ſuch full joy in any thing, as I do in communion with my God. 10. I ſee a purity and glory in the ways of God, and Goſpel-duties above all things. 11. I deſire no longer to live than to glorifie God. 12. All the days of my appointed time, I wait till my change ſhall come. <hi>H. W.</hi>

               <p>IT hath pleaſed the Lord ever ſince I knew a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between good and evil, to give me a heart to ſeek after thoſe things which ſavoured moſt of God. And it was my delight always to frequent the ſociety of thoſe whom I thought were truly godly: And upon this account, I thought
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:153892:63"/> my ſelf to be ſomething, when being ſeriouſly weighed, I became nothing; for I knew God but as a natural man doth, even by way of diſcourſe; I being, as I conceive ſince, much in the poſture of the proud Phariſee, I could ſay, I thank God, I was not ſuch a perſon, as was given to lewd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or vice, as others were: And being thus in my natural condition, I thought I had need of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when I was as the Church of the <hi>Laodiceans, wretched, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked,</hi> and that which was worſt, I knew not that I was thus in ignorance, walking in darkneſs till the Lord brought me forth into the light; Firſt, By con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing me of ſin. Secondly, Convincing me of righteouſneſs. The firſt was (according to my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance) about ſeven or eight years ſince.</p>
               <p>I being in diſcourſe with a friend, concerning ſomething which did much diſpleaſe me, wherein my anſwering was very croſs, and my words very full of anger, I began to eſpy my ſelf full of malice and envy, which did much reflect upon my own heart, and cauſed a wonderful grief un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me; and having never taken notice of any ſuch thing before, it was ſo much the more ſtrange to me; but calling my ſelf to a ſtrict examination what foundation I had laid, when the Building began to prove ſo rotten, it pleaſed the Lotd, that thereby I grew more and more ſenſible of my own miſerable condition, as being in the ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, a child of wrath, finding my ſelf a lump of ſin and uncleanneſs, and at a far diſtance from the ways of God, and to be in probability of nothing ſo much as of damnation, and ready to be caſt into Hell for my ſins, finding my ſelf out of Chriſt, and not any hope that I ſhould ever gain an intereſt in him; for I ſaw that without <hi>Faith it was impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to pleaſe him,</hi> and that without Faith I could
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:153892:64"/> not think of any way to pleaſe him being loſt in falſe ways of my own invention. And conſidering alſo, that <hi>Paul</hi> counſels the <hi>Corinthians</hi> to <hi>examine them ſelves whether they were in the faith,</hi> and (ſaith he) <hi>Know ye not your own ſelves, whether Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be Reprobates,</hi> and following this courſe, I could not otherwiſe judge, but that I was a Reprobate, and this condition was very bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſom unto my ſpirit, and neither in hearing or reading, could I for the time find any eaſe of this my trouble, but ſtill I did apprehend the Lord as an angry Judge, requiring ſatisfaction of me for my ſins.</p>
               <p>Thus I languiſhed, not knowing which way to ſteer my thoughts; but oftentimes crying out to the throne of grace, what ſhall I do to be ſaved? Sometimes I ſhould perſwade my ſelf it was alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether impoſſible for me to think of being ſaved, or ever to gain ſo much faith, as to believe that Chriſt dyed for my ſins, for I thought it would be a very great preſumption in me to attempt any ſuch thing, having often had thoughts of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſelf. It is my deſire that I may never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the providence of God in keeping me from all dangers in this my extream doubtful condition, wherein I made not any one acquainted with my trouble but the Lord, whoſe work it was to deliver me. In this my ſpiritual bondage, when I have heard godly men incouraging poor Souls to believe in Chriſt, I have thought that others might, but I durſt not preſume, becauſe I was no better quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied; for if I could find my ſelf more holy, or more godly, or fuller of goodneſs, then there would be ſome hope that I might believe, and hope for the favour of God, and that Chriſt dyed for me.</p>
               <p>But afterwards, God put into my heart to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:153892:64"/> that ſeeing <hi>By the deeds of the Law, no fleſh can be juſtified;</hi> (for <hi>I</hi> thought before, I muſt have done ſomething that ſhould have proved meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) and beginning to be acquainted with an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs in my ſelf, and an inability of my own to do any good, and find that it muſt be given me from the Lord, Chriſt being <hi>all in all</hi> to the Saints. Upon this conſideration I caſt my ſelf upon God, ſaying, <hi>Lord, I am thy workmanſhip, do with me what ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good unto thee: If thou doſt damn me, I have deſerved the ſevereſt of thy judgments; thou art juſt, although I am for ever juſtly miſerable.</hi> And one day reading of Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> his Book, treating of the ſmalleſt degree of ſaving-faith, which did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, that a <hi>deſire to believe was faith it ſelf,</hi> I was ſomething comforted to hear of this, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that none could more deſire it than I did, and upon this, a while, I reſted ſatisfied: But not long after I found it a reed, whereon I had leaned, and grew again very reſtleſs, and was beat off from this ſtay by having the opportunity of another Book, which made me to underſtand that the poor man knew full well that a deſire to be rich, and to be rich indeed, were two ſeveral things: And ſo a deſire to believe, and faith it ſelf, was not the ſame. For as all that deſire to be rich, are not rich, ſo all that deſire to believe, do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
               <p>Being thus drove from my other principle, I began to ſee a more emptineſs in the creature, and a greater fulneſs in the Creatour. And this laſt book by the bleſſing of God, through his grace did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form my judgment in many things, which were very comfortable to me. As that the love of God was the cauſe Chriſt was given for ſinners, and that he became a full ſatisfaction to God for ſins, and if we ſtaid from Chriſt till we were full of good works
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:153892:65"/> it might be a ſymptom we ſhould never believe: For it ſhewed that we muſt be ingrafted into Chriſt by faith, before we could bring forth good fruits, for <hi>without me ye can do nothing,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>And whatſoever is not of faith, is ſin,</hi> Theſe and many ſuch like expreſſions in the Scripture, which God put into my mind, were very comfortable to the refreſhing of my dull and weary ſpirit many times; but yet fears in intervals poſſeſſed me, as not finding Chriſt to be made mine by Faith. For I could not ſay (in particular) that God was my God, nor ſee that there was a reconcilement made between God and my Soul. Sometimes I would perſwade my heart to venture to believe in Chriſt for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of my ſins; But preſently objections would thwart my reſolutions, by concluding that I was too great a ſinner: And it was not abſolutely ſaid, that Chriſt dyed for me.</p>
               <p>In this condition I was for about four years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I did thoroughly apprehend the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus unto me: Yet the Lord was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at laſt, to work effectually upon me, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſweet promiſes out of his Word, which did wonderfully rejoyce my Soul, As John 13.15, 16. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in the Son ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> This very word <hi>whoſoever,</hi> did work ſo kindly, and with ſuch a ſweet efficacy upon my heart, that I was conſtrained to ſubmit, having <hi>not any objection</hi> againſt it, for it compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended all ſorts of ſinners, although never ſo great, yet <hi>whoſoever believeth in this Son</hi> of God, ſhall injoy ſuch a ſweet promiſe, no leſs than eternal <hi>life.</hi> In the 16. verſe. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> And in Acts 10.43. <hi>That whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> Then in Gal. 2.20. <hi>I
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:153892:65"/> live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me, and gave himſelf for me;</hi> and <hi>Chriſt Jeſus dyed for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, of whom I am chief:</hi> Seeing this application of Chriſt, that <hi>Paul</hi> made in particular to himſelf, who was a very great ſinner, it did much imbol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den me in the like, Rom. 5.8, 9. <hi>God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, Chriſt dyed for the ungodly:</hi> and I was ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, therefore I believed Chriſt dyed for me, <hi>and when we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt dyed for ſinners;</hi> I am a ſinner, and therefore Chriſt dyed for me, and <hi>he was reconciled unto us, while we were enemies;</hi> For the Lord to be thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to ungodly, to ſinners, to enemies, this was more love indeed than ever I expected: Eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the Lord would have been half ſo gracious to me: This turned all my former ſorrows into joy; crying out, <hi>what ſhall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits that he hath beſtowed upon me: For what was I, or any of my Fathers houſe, that the Lord ſhould be ſo merciful unto me?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And I have theſe teſtimonis of my real converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to God. 1. The teſtimony of his ſpirit adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to be his child, Gal. 3.4, 5. <hi>God ſent forth his Son to redeem thoſe that are under the law, that they may receive the adoption of Sons. And becauſe you are Sons, God hath ſent ſorth the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba Father; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou art no more a ſervant but a Son:</hi> I was once under the law dead, I am now by Chriſt redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And I bleſs God for this precious priviledge, that I can call God my Father. 2. Chriſt hath fulfilled the law, therefore I ſhall not be condem<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ned by the Law, but juſtified by Jeſus Chriſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deeds of the Law; there was a time when I was dead in ſin, and in ungodlineſs, being <hi>alienated from the Common-wealth of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and a ſtranger to
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:153892:66"/> the Covenant of grace, having no hope, and without God in the world:</hi> But being made alive by Jeſus Chriſt, I ſee my ſins done away; and do believe that Chriſt hath born on his body all my ſins, he being <hi>bruiſed for our tranſgreſſions,</hi> Iſa. 53. And the Lord laid on him <hi>the iniquity of us all, by whoſe ſtripes we are healed:</hi> So that I do believe that by <hi>one offering he hath perfected for ever all thoſe that are ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And that Chriſt Jeſus is become a full and perfect ſatisfaction for my ſins, and that the Lord is well pleaſed with, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in this ſatisfaction, Mat. 3. <hi>That is my well-beloved Son in whom I am well pleaſed.</hi>

               <p n="3">3. I am in and through Gods free grace, what I am; not for any thing in me, or that I could do, but as in Titus 4.5. <hi>We our ſelves were ſometimes fooliſh, diſobedient, ſerving divers luſts; but when the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour appeared towards man, not by works of righteouſneſs which we have done, but according to his mercy he ſaved us: That being juſtified freely by his grace, we ſhould be made heirs, according to the hope of eternal life:</hi> And in another place, 1 Tim. 1.9. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, before the world began;</hi> Therefore I believe, that God the Father loveth me in Jeſus Chriſt, 1 John 4.19. <hi>We love him becauſe he loved us firſt,</hi> John 14.14 <hi>Ye have not choſen me, but I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you, that you ſhould bring forth much fruit.</hi> Iſa. 43.25. <hi>I, even I am he that blotteth out all thy tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions for my own ſake, and will not remember thy iniquities,</hi> and he will have mercy, even becauſe he will have mercy: The blood of Jeſus Chriſt clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth us from all ſins, I plainly ſee it is the Lords doings, and it is marvellous in my eyes. As in Epheſ. 2. <hi>You who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:153892:66"/> hath he quickned together with him, by Grace ye are ſaved, and that not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God.</hi> I find as Chriſt Jeſus was a free gift to me, and for me, ſo was this ſaving grace of faith a free gift alſo from the Lord to my Soul, Rom. 3.24. <hi>Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that is in Chriſt Jeſus, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins, that he might be juſt, and the juſtifier of him that believeth</hi> in Jeſus; ſo that all boaſting of the creature is excluded by the law of faith. <hi>As by the diſobedience of one, many were made ſinners, ſo by the obedience of one, ſhall many be made righteous.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. I believe, that as there was no ſin found in Chriſt, and yet a ſinner by imputation, ſo I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſinner indeed, ſhall be made righteous by Gods imputation; For it pleaſed God to make him <hi>become ſin for us who knew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. I have the ſeal of the ſpirit, as <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſpirit of God beareth witneſs with our ſpirits, that we are the children of God, and if children, then Heirs of God, and joynt heirs with Chriſt</hi> in this our freedom.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>I</hi> do believe that God the Father loved me, and elected me for the Son to redeem, and that Jeſus Chriſt loves me, as given of the Father for him to redeem, and manifeſts it to me: And the Holy Ghoſt loves me, as elected of the Father, and redeemed by the Son, and doth evidence it in me, which is the earneſt of my inheritance; and there is an expreſſion in <hi>John</hi> 3. laſt. <hi>He that believeth in the Son hath everlaſting life.</hi>

What we receive now, is but a taſt of what we ſhall receive; As 1 John 4.2. <hi>Beloved, now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be, but we know that when we ſhall appear, we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> 3. I do injoy it by my head Chriſt, who hath taken full poſſeſſion of it already for me: Therefore ſeeing I am not my own, I am bought with a price, therefore I deſire to glorifie God with my Soul and Body, which are the Lords, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with <hi>Mary</hi> in Luke 1. <hi>My Soul doth magnifie the Lord, and my Spirit doth rejoyce in God my Saviour, who hath regarded the low eſtate of his hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8. Though formerly my ſoundation was built upon the ſands, and therefore eaſily overthrown: Yet now I truſt in the Lord I am eſtabliſhed by Faith, built upon that Rock, which is the love of God, my Saviour Chriſt being the corner ſtone, Iſa. 28.16. <hi>Behold I lay in</hi> Zion <hi>a ſtone, a tryed ſtone, he that believeth ſhall not make haſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9.

               <p n="10">10. I believe not upon others words, but as in <hi>John</hi> 4.42. as ſome ſaid to the Woman of <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.

               </p>
               <p n="11">11. As <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>I had fainted unleſs I had believed to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>I believe, therefore have I ſpoken, for I was greatly afflicted.</hi>

               <p n="12">12. The Lord having cleared it to me, that I am a believer, I am confident that Chriſt Jeſus did pray to his Father for me, in the 17. of <hi>John,</hi> ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>I pray not for theſe only, hut for them that ſhall believe through their word, that they may be one, even as we are one,</hi> therefore thou art my God, and I will praiſe thee, for thou haſt heard me, and art become my ſalvation.</p>
               <p>Thus in ſome meaſure I have weakly hinted out a reaſon of the hope that is in me, truſting in my God, that as he hath taken away the guilt of ſin out of my conſcience, ſo in his due time he will take away all ſin from my converſation; as he hath given me a pardon for ſin, ſo he will over-power all my corruptions, that I may live more to the praiſe of the glory of his grace, wherein he hath made me accepted in the Beloved, and that I ſhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come (over ſin, Satan, ſelf, and all things oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to grace) more than a Conqueror through him that hath loved me, and waſhed me from my ſins in his blood; for to him are all things poſſible, and he is the wiſe Maſter-Builder, who will not only begin, but will go on to accompliſh his own work. <hi>D.

               </head>
               <p>I Have undergone ſad troubles of ſpirit for my ſins, which I have had a great fight and ſenſe of and ſhed many tears for, and deſire to be truly ſorry for them, and hate them, and to have no more communion with them.</p>
               <p>About two years I lay under very great tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and was ready to deſpair, and for ſeveral nights could not take any reſt in my bed; but was very weak with weeping, and much grieved for my evil thoughts, yet the Lord drew forth my
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:153892:68"/> heart to call upon him, and hope in him for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. But I had many ſore conflicts, inſomuch that I could not lye in the chamber alone; I made what uſe I could of opportunities to deſire comfort from ſuch godly Chriſtians as I could meet withal to counſel me in the ways of God, and I laboured to hearken to them, but found my heart very dull and heavy for a time, untill about three years ſince, I began to find comfort from ſome Sermons that I heard, and books that I read, and ſome thoughts that the Lord ſettled upon my heart by his ſpirit, hoping that there was mercy for me. And I did believe that I had all the prayers of all the Saints in the world put up to the Throne of grace for me, and that my Saviour had ſatisfied for my ſins, and through him God was reconciled to me, and in particular I found comfort from theſe and ſome other promiſes, John 16.35. <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me, ſhall never hunger, and he that believeth on me, ſhall never thirſt.</hi> Verſe 37. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me, and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> John 14.1. <hi>Let not your hearts be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled ye believe in God, believe alſo in me,</hi> Jerem. 31.23. <hi>But this ſhall be the Covenant that I will make with the houſe of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>After thoſe days ſaith the Lord, I will put my Law in their inward parts, and write it in their Hearts, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people.</hi> And I do find in my heart a teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my believing, &amp; that I do love God, wrought in me by his bleſſed Spirit, by theſe particulars.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I love God, not through ſlaviſh fear, but for his name and glory, ſo that I can leave all for him, and nothing is ſo dear and precious unto me, as the love of God; and nothing ſo great a joy to me, as that Chriſt who dyed for me, hath not left me. 2. I find ſuch comfort from the Lord, that he by
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:153892:68"/> his Spirit revives my drooping heart, and fills my empty Soul, and when my poor ſpirit is even fainting away, I find comfort from his glorious pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and preſence. 3. When I cannot come to Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances it is a grief to me, and when I am in duty it is a grief to me that I am ſo dull and find no more inlargement; yet my affections are groaning after the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in Duties, and I have a great longing to receive more of Chriſt. And I find more comfort when my heart is inlarged in duty, than in any other thing in the World, and I know that all my comfort is from Jeſus Chriſt. 4. What I deſire to injoy, I ſeek to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy it in God through peace of conſcience, that it may be to the comfort of my faith, for God is pure, and it is a great grief to me that I c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </head>
               <p>I Have from my child-hood deſired to ſerve the Lord, and to make his Commandments my rule to walk by; and I thought once that I could have ſaid with the young man in the Goſpel, <hi>All theſe have I kept from my youth.</hi> But it pleaſed the Lord to viſit me with a grievous ſickneſs, even unto death; and then my heart told me that I was a great ſinner, and my conſcience accuſed me, that I had loved the world more than I had loved Jeſus Chriſt. Then I was afflicted in my ſpirit with fear, becauſe I could not believe that Jeſus Chriſt had dyed for me. I beſought the Lord by earneſt pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he would be pleaſed to ſpare me, for I found my ſelf to be very unfit for death. I made Promiſes to the Lord, that if he did pleaſe to ſpare
<pb facs="tcp:153892:69"/> me, I would lead a new life, and did reſolve to walk more cloſe to my God. The Lord was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in mercy, to hear my Prayer, and grant this requeſt, and ſpare me a while longer to ſerve him in the land of the living.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding my promiſes, and the great deliverance the Lord had wrought for me in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me back from Hell, and the Grave, I had ſoon forgotten all. I began to love the world again, and lived as vainly as before. But the Lord ſmote my conſcience, and ſorely troubled my ſpirit for this backſliding, putting me in mind of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes I had made to him in my ſickneſs. With great bitterneſs of heart and grief of Soul, I mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for my failings, and did again reſolve, for the time to come to keep more cloſe to God, and ſet a watch over my heart. But the more I looked in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my heart, the more vile I ſaw my ſelf to be, and was greatly troubled that I had ſo often played the hypocrite with my God. I again beſought the Lord by prayer, that he would be pleaſed, for Jeſus Chriſt his ſake to forgive all my ſins, and backſlidings, which I then was grieved for, with loathing, more than ever before.</p>
               <p>My conſcience was ſo wounded, and my Soul caſt down in ſo great a conflict, that my ſpirits were almoſt dryed up, and my heart began to grow weary and faint with crying and groaning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my Saviour. Yet the Lord was pleaſed to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me ſtill more and more, and to try me further, as gold is tryed in the fire. And my afflictions were doubled upon me by Satans malice, who tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with evil thoughts, which was grievous to my Soul. When I had prayed (with a troubled ſpirit as well as I could) the Devil put thoughts into my mind, quite contrary to the frame of a praying ſpirit. When I had read the word of God;
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:153892:69"/> he tempted me with doubts and queſtions, touching ſome things therein, whether it was truth or not. And Satan followed his temptations ſo cloſe upon me, that as ſoon as the Lord had inabled me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe one temptation, the Devil aſſaulted me with another, ſo that I had ſcarce time to fetch my breath, one temptation followed ſo cloſe upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>Being troubled much in my ſpirit in this condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I was tempted to diſcontent, that the Lord had not taken away theſe Temptations from me, and in anger fell into ſome great paſſions, even near unto deſperation. And I was ſorely buffeted by the Devil, in this my loweſt extremity, who aſſaulted me with freſh temptations of blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous thoughts touching God, ſo that when in the bitterneſs of my Soul I was ſeeking after Jeſus Chriſt, and had named God, he would put into my mind the objects of the brute Creatures, and even whilſt I was pouring out my Soul to the Creator, and was pleading a promiſe, he brought a curſe to my thoughts. Thus was I repulſed in all duties by Satans terrifying my Soul to perſwade me, that it was in vain for me to ſeek for Salvation, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I had committed the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt (which God by his word hath declared ſhall never be forgiven neither in this World, nor in the World to come) becauſe I was diſcontented that the Lord after all my addreſſes to him had not delivered me from all my troubles. But the Lord gave me ſtrength to reſiſt Satan, and ſay in the bitterneſs of my Soul to my God, far be it from me O Lord, to be offended with thee. And the Lord wrought this reſolution in my Soul, that I did proteſt before the Lord, that although I ſhould ſee nothing but Hell before me, yet I would truſt in him, and ſtay my ſelf upon my God, until

I made my caſe known to a dear friend, who gave me ſome comfort; he told me, that the ſin againſt the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, was to ſin wilfully, by perpetual deſpite againſt God: I found a clear teſtimony in my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that I was ſo far from deſpiting the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of grace, that I had not ſinned willingly againſt God, for I found it to be an affliction to me to be tempted with evil thoughts touching the Lord, tho' I conſented not to them; and I found my Soul grieved that I could not be freed from them. And then with abundance of tears, by often prayers and ſupplications to the Throne of Grace, I pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſorth my ſinful Soul at the foot-ſtool of Gods mercy, exalting free grace, and pleading the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable riches of the mercies of God, that would appear in the converſion of ſuch a ſinner as I had been. Methoughts it ſeemed to exalt Gods mercy, and to be one of the greateſt manifeſtations of free grace in the world, to be to the great glory of the Lord, and unſpeakable comfort of my poor Soul, if he would be pleaſed to bring me to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
               <p>Now when, by the Divine power of God, my heart was thus reſolved to truſt in him and to wait upon him, then the Lord was pleaſed to ſhew me to my comfort, the example of Jeſus Chriſt, who had no ſin in himſelf, yet he was tempted of the Devil. And likewiſe of <hi>Paul,</hi> how Satan ſent ſent a <hi>meſſenger to buffet him,</hi> who then prayed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God, and the Lord ſaid, <hi>my grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> my power is made known in thy weakneſs. Then I began to be comforted and to think if Chriſt himſelf was tempted, if the children of God who had been eminent examples, had lain under temptations, and the Lord according to his promiſes had ſtrengthned and delivered them,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:153892:72"/> there was hope for me. And the Lord wrought faith in my heart to believe, that he would ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en me, and keep me that I ſhould not periſh for ever.</p>
               <p>And I have ſince found great conſolation in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny promiſes, which the Lord hath revealed in his Word, which I have pleaded before him, ſome of which follow. Iſaiah 50.10. <hi>Who is among you, that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth the voice of his Servant, that walketh in darkneſs and hath no light, let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God.</hi> I applyed this promiſe thus, I had walked in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſaw no light, but God had wrought in my heart to fear him, and a willingneſs to obey my Saviour, and a reſolution to truſt in the name of the Lord, therefore I knew it was not in vain to ſtay my ſelf upon my God. And <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.20. (It is ſaid by Chriſt) <hi>A bruiſed reed ſhall he not break, and ſmoaking flax ſhall he not quench, till he ſend forth judgment unto victory.</hi> The Lord having broken and bruiſed me in the ſenſe of ſin, and drawn forth my heart to rely upon him, I believed that he would in the end give me victory through Chriſt, and Iſa. 40.29. <hi>He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might he increaſeth ſtrength.</hi> This promiſe I laid hold on, becauſe Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt, Mat.</hi> 11.28. When I had refreſhed my ſpirit by applying theſe and ſome other Promiſes to my own Soul, by faith in the Lord Jeſus, I found an effect of my faith by that love to God, which by his holy Spirit he had wrought in my Soul, which appeareth by theſe particular Evidences.</p>
               <p n="1">1. I am grieved that I have been ſo unbelieving towards God, and ſo impatient in my afflictions. 2. I am troubled to think that whilſt I live here
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:153892:73"/> in this mortal fleſh, I cannot be quite <hi>freed</hi> from ſin, but muſt live to offend ſo good a God, who hath wrought ſo great a deliverance for me. 3. I bleſs the Lord, I can (through Divine goodneſs from the teſtimony of the bleſſed Spirit) ſay with comfort the Lord is my God, whereby I can cry, <hi>Abba Father.</hi> 4. I can I hope willingly deny my ſelf in all things, and ſhould the Lord call me to it take up the Croſs of my Saviour Jeſus to follow him, and bleſs God in all diſpenſations whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. 5. I find a total deſire, and willingneſs in my heart to ſurrender my ſelf to be led by Gods bleſſed Spirit, in all holineſs and piety, with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, that I may live all my days to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of my God. 6. My affections are more firmly and really knit to God than to any thing, ſo that I can part with any thing for God; and I value my intereſt in God above all things, and I find more joy in him than in all things. 7. I am not now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to dye, ſhould God call me, that I may go to be with my Saviour for ever. 8. I deſire to be in love and charity with all men, but in an eſpecial manner I do love the godly, becauſe in appearance they are the children of God, and I deſire to feed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Chriſt by faith in his Ordinances. <hi>M.

               </head>
               <p>AT the beginning of the Civil Wars, I as well as others was much frighted; and when it was ſaid that ſuch a day the City ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, I was amazed; I had been a hearer a great while of very eminent Miniſters in the City of <hi>London,</hi> yet profited very little by what I heard. For if they preached the mercies of God, I fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they did not belong to me, becauſe I could not find thoſe qualifications in me which I thought I ought to have, if I expected to receive mercy. I could rejoyce in hearing of the promiſes, but could
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:153892:73"/> not lay hold on them as belonging to me; but ſtill I went to hear though with much trouble of mind. That day wherein it was ſaid, the City ſhould be deſtroyed, I began to call my ſelf to account, what would become of my Soul, if it ſhould be ſo: I was almoſt amazed, but did much deſire of God that he would give me faith, and with the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can <hi>I</hi> ſaid, <hi>Lord I believe, help my unbelief;</hi> I then reſolved with my ſelf, well, I will caſt my Soul into the arms of God, <hi>If I periſh, I periſh.</hi> And through belief in him, I was quieted in my ſpirit at that time: But my ſenſe of peace was ſoon vailed. And I was afterward ſore afflicted with the fight of my ſin, and was fully perſwaded that I was an Hypocrite, and that all that I did was but for fear of Hell, then durſt I not be any where a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, for fear of the ſight of the Devil, and if I had been at prayer by my ſelf, I durſt not open my eyes.</p>
               <p>Thus was I perplexed with fear and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded my ſelf I ſhould periſh; my condition was very bitter to me, and I did much labour for a reſting place for my Soul. And being one day at a Funeral, the Miniſter that preached the Sermon, ſhewed the ſufficiency of God, and the inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of man, and that all good came from God. He ſaid, that it was as poſſible for that dead man to put life into himſelf, as for any man to gain the leaſt drop of grace of himſelf, <hi>for Faith is the gift of God.</hi> Then I began to conſider with my ſelf, and to take notice of the promiſes of God; and I would write them to keep them about me: I then being a Hearer at St. <hi>M.</hi> the Miniſter was much upon the affairs of the times, and I was much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled about what I heard, for I found not my Soul ſatisfied with that matter. When I came home, I found that my Soul was not able to live with that
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:153892:74"/> food: and it pleaſed the Lord to direct me to hear Mr. <hi>Sympſon</hi> at <hi>All-hollows Thames Street</hi> and he was ſetting forth the free grace of God to poor ſinners.</p>
               <p>And then I began to reaſon with my ſelf, that ſurely in putting all mercy from me, I did diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, for he inviteth all to believe his promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. And I read that he ſaith, <hi>As I live I deſire not the death of a ſinner.</hi> And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>he came to ſave ſinners,</hi> and that <hi>the whole need not a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, but thoſe that are ſick:</hi> And God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, <hi>not to break the bruiſed reed, nor quench the ſmoaking flax; and Chriſt dyed for the ungodly, and God is no reſpecter of perſons.</hi> And Chriſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, <hi>That whoſoever comes unto him, he will in no wiſe caſt off.</hi> When I had conſidered theſe and other promiſes; And that place where it is ſaid, <hi>that without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God,</hi> then I was earneſt with God, that he would give me faith and ſincerity of <hi>Heart,</hi> And that place did much refreſh me, <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Yet again after all this, the ſenſe of mine own unworthineſs did much trouble me, and I was greatly grieved that I was ſo cumbred in the world, and began to doubt, ſaying, ſure I have not cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the better part.</p>
               <p>For ſometimes I ſhould rejoyce, and praiſe God being much ſatisfied from thoſe places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ſay; <hi>He hath laid our iniquities on him, and he hath laid help on him that is mighty.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Ye are ſaved by grace, not of your ſelves, it is the gift of God:</hi> And, <hi>We have an Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate with the Father, even Jeſus Chriſt the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. And he was made ſin for us that keew no ſin, that we might be made the righteouſneſs of God in him.</hi> And, <hi>behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World.</hi> But in a ſhort time I ſhould loſe all my ſenſe of comfort, and than I had ſad thoughts,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:153892:74"/> muſing what God would do with me. In the depth of theſe conflicts, at laſt that place refreſhed me, where God ſaith, <hi>I the Lord change not, therefore ye Sons of</hi> Jacob <hi>are not conſumed.</hi> Though before I was not ſatisfied that my faith was true, but doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſurely I had preſumed upon falſe grounds, and was much perplexed, yet now it pleaſed God in the midſt of my diſtreſs, to bring to my mind theſe words, <hi>The Spirit ſaith come, and the Bride ſaith come, and every one that will come, drink of the water of life freely.</hi> I ſaid, of my ſelf I cannot come: But I prayed, Lord <hi>draw me, and I ſhall run after thee.</hi> And this word was caſt into my Soul by the Lord, <hi>My grace is ſufficient for thee,</hi> only do thou believe. And God hath now wrought faith in me, and by the teſtimony of his Spirit hath ſealed his love in Chriſt to me, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in my heart ſo to love him, that I have caſt my ſelf wholly upon him. <hi>H.

                  <hi>Portugal,</hi> but they detained us a whole year, ſo that our Ship was all eaten with worms, and we were fain to keep pumping for nine months, but the longer the worſe, for in our paſſage homeward we could not tell which death to chuſe, either to ſtarve, or to be drowned, for our Victuals was ſo ſmall, that for one year and more we had no bread in our Ship, but eat the roots of Trees, made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſubſtance like Oatmeal, and for Beef, one ounce for a man a day which ſtunk ſo that none could have eat it but men in our caſe; for Drink, we were glad of a pint of water a day during the time of our paſſage, which was ſeventeen weeks; but in this paſſage we ſaw the wonderful works of God, for he ſent us for three eeks in ſeaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble times, fiſh called Dolphins, ſometimes two or three in a day; And as we grew within three hundred Leagues of the Coaſt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and our Proviſion near ſpent, only three or four days left, and all our men ſick, and weak, and almoſt ſtarved, it pleaſed God of his great mercy to ſend us a Ship of <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> a Man of War, who proved to us as <hi>Joſeph,</hi> to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> for they brought us Victuals which ſaved our lives, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had taken our Ship, they were fain to put on board forty men to keep her from ſinking, for it pleaſed God that the next day after we had a violent Storm, and a great Sea broke upon her, ſo that we thought ſhe would never have recovered her ſelf again, for our goods did ſhut all to one ſide, and ſo ſhe was fain to go untill ſhe came to <hi>Fluſhing,</hi> but we poor creatures were in great pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril and danger of our Lives, and yet the Lord comforted me by his Promiſe, That he would bring me to ſhore, and would deliver my life from death, and my eyes from tears; and he hath done graciouſly with me above my deſerts, and inabled

               <p>Three years after this being on the Coaſt of <hi>Ireland,</hi> it pleaſed the Lord to raiſe a violent Storm, and in the morning by the dawning of the day, we were ſo near the Shore, that to mans judgment there was nothing but death approaching, for we knew no place of that Land by reaſon of the Fogg, and Rain that we had all the day, and knew not where to go, but as the Lord, who is the Pilot of Pilots did carry us, untill four a clock at Night, which in <hi>December</hi> is dark, and then we came to a great high head-land, and a little without that lay a great ſand, ſo that we could not go any other way but betwixt them; being then paſt all hopes of life, we forced her through the Sea, ſo that it brake over our heads, inſomuch that we could not tell whether we were in the Sea or the Bark, but by our feet and hands, for we could not ſee for the violence of the water, only he that was at the Helm: And yet in the ſpace of a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of an hour we were in a ſafe place, newly ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of the jaws of death.

               <p>IT hath pleaſed the Lord God of his own free mercy and love in Jeſus Chriſt to prevent and keep me ever ſince I was born from many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dangers, and yet I like an unruly Creature, have kicked at his Fatherly protection, and run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many groſs and vile ſins. The firſt groſs one was, many kinds of unlawful gaming, which held me as a bond-ſlave near thirty years, to the great endangering both of my Body and Soul, but yet it pleaſed the Lord to look graciouſly upon me, and to give me afterwards an hatred againſt this vice, and withal, he put into my mind a reſolution, which I confirmed with a vow, as followeth: <q>That as
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:153892:76"/> I loved God and his Word, or my own Soul, I would never play at any game for money ſo long as I lived.</q> The Lord was pleaſed to accept of my good will, and bleſſed me and mine in my law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full calling many years, untill at the laſt that old Serpent the Devil, envying my happy proceedings in this Reformation, he drew me into many other ſins, which had almoſt brought me to as bad an end as the firſt. But the Lord out of the loweſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities gives in remedies to his Children, and he gave me an hatred againſt them alſo, and a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, <hi>Never to commit them any more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet about two or three years after, that old ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of mankind, Satan, that roaring Lion ſeeking whom he may devour, came again with turnings to deſtroy me, perſwading me, that to drink with my Neighbours, was acceptable to God (which may be uſed without exceſs) but I gave will the full reins, which brought me back again to my former courſes, withal annexing wrath and anger to my Houſe and Family, perſwading me that I muſt rule in my houſe, which had brought me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides my ſelf, had not God helped me, who never fails thoſe whom he loves, and that put their truſt in him: For preſently upon this extremity, he ſent this remedy. 1. A ſight of my ſins: 2. A grief and ſorrow for them: 3. A reſolution to leave them: And 4. The Lord carryed me through a way to leave them, which was thus.</p>
               <p>I began to call to mind what was the greateſt thing I loved in this World, and in the World to come, beſides thoſe that I named before, which I ſet oppoſite to theſe two monſters: Then I vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Lord, deſiring his aſſiſtance, <q>That as I loved the Holy Ghoſt the comforter, or ever looked to have comfort from the bleſſed commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the body and blood of Chriſt Jeſus to
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:153892:77"/> cleanſe my ſins, ſo if I did remember or was in perfect ſenſe, I would never drink above two rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable glaſſes, or cups of Wine, or four cups of Beer in any one place, or at any one time, <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Equivocation,</hi> And that at any time when I came into the doors of my houſe, if there were any controverſie in my Family, that then I would with gentle perſwaſions do my beſt indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to end it;</q> And this with Gods help I would perform. And I prayed, <q>O Lord my God, bleſs my hand and my heart to perform thy will, that when any temptation to gaming or drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or luſt ſhall aſſault me, either by thought or any other means, that then preſently I may fly unto thee in the name of Chriſt Jeſus my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</q> And I do ſtill fly unto God, confeſſing and ſorrowing for my ſins, deſiring the Lord to help and aſſiſt me to perform and keep all theſe, and in all thing to ſerve God as long as I live. I cannot be ſo humbled for my ſins as I deſire, yet have I had much trouble for ſin, and have ſhed tears many a time, and I have been much troubled that my heart cannot be broken enough; yet I have had many croſſes, but I know it is the hand of God, and I deſire to lye low before him.</p>
               <p>When God firſt diſcovered my ſins to me, I was was much terrified. But I have found much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in that glorious promiſe, which God made when <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, that <hi>The ſeed of the Woman ſhould break the Serpents head, Gen.</hi> 3.

In that the Lord (bleſſed be his holy name) hath ſo ſetled my heart on himſelf, that I could leave friends, relations, and all things for God. 2. I find in my heart a real affection and love ſtrongly carryed out to all the children of God, and I love to do good to the people of God. 3. I take much delight to hear the word of God preached, and to partake of duties with the people of God &amp; to have communion with God in private duties. 4. I am troubled when my heart is cold in duty, but much comforted, when my heart is inlarged towards God. 5. I believe that God will ſave me through Chriſt for ever. <hi>T. G.</hi>

               <p>IN my youthful age it pleaſed God to give me an heart to take delight to hear the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at many places, but eſpecially at St. <hi>Antholins</hi> at the morning Lectures, and this I did often for ſome time, untill Satan ſtirred up many Inſtruments to call me Puritan with many other reproachful tearms, that made me aſhamed to go in publick; but like <hi>Nicodemus</hi> by ſtealth, as it were, in the dark: But it pleaſed the Lord to convince me of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans wiles, that he was a deceiver from the firſt, and that in hearing the word Preached, thoſe that would be Souldiers in Chriſts School, muſt not be daun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for every foyl; and <q>If I did look for Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by Jeſus Chriſt, I muſt manfully fight under the Banner of Chriſt, and hold out to the end, if I would be ſaved.</q> From the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereof, God was pleaſed to put courage into
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:153892:78"/> my heart, to hold on in the ways of God, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the Goſpel, which I did, though with abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of weakneſs and difficulties; and thus I did continually go on though darkly, until it pleaſed God to break forth in his moſt glorious <hi>light;</hi> for by ſpecial providence I was brought to ſee an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ruine to my Soul without a Chriſt; and tho' I had heard much of Chriſt by the outward ear, yet had I no experimental knowledge of him, till the word of Chriſt ſhewed me, that my condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſuch as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of to the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that <hi>I was dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, and except I was quickned by the Spirit, and by Faith did bath my Soul in the blood of Chriſt, I was an undone creature, notwithſtanding all my long hearing the word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having then weighed many circumſtances, and had conference with many of the people of God, both Preachers and others, I was very much ſtrengthened in faith, and had an aſſurance of the love of God in Chriſt Jeſus, whereby I did find much comfort to my Soul; and ſince hearing ſome able Miniſters of the Goſpel hold forth moſt preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truths, I found much comfort: And more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly Mr. <hi>Bridges</hi> of <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> opening that comfortable Scripture, Pſal. 41.11. <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my Soul, why art thou diſquieted within me? truſt in God, &amp;c.</hi> His Doctrine was, <q>That a godly man had no juſt cauſe to be diſcouraged, whatſoever his condition was; either the ſence of ſin, or the temptations of Satan, or trouble, or afflictions; that a man had cauſe to be humbled for the leaſt ſin, but not to be diſcouraged at the greateſt, from truſting in God, but to rely upon the <hi>Lord by Faith in Chriſt,</hi> whatſoever his diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements were;</q> which hath ſince cauſed me to walk in a thankful poſture towards God for his
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:153892:78"/> unſpeakable mercy; and <hi>It is my great grief, that I can be no more thankful, ſeeing I have received ſo much mercy from God, whom I do daily offend;</hi> which hath made me with <hi>Paul</hi> to cry out, <hi>O wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of death!</hi> But that the next words produce comfort, <hi>bleſſed be God through Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Yet after this, it pleaſed God, to ſuffer me to fall into a ſinful condition, by being too confident in my own ſtrength, which fall coſt me abundance of tears, ſighs and ſobbings of heart, even as <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>to the breaking and drying of my bones:</hi> It made me walk ſadly for many months together, &amp; even to deſpair of any help. And ſeeing I had brought ſo much diſhonour to God, and ſcandal to the Goſpel, and reproach to the Profeſſors thereof, this did much preſs my ſoul; <q>Conſidering what a Profeſſor, I was before, in ſtanding for the glory of God, and oppoſing all gainſayers, and for me to fall; Oh! this did make ſuch gaſhes in my ſoul, that the conſideration thereof, cauſed me to walk ſadly, and ſorrowfully, and with ſo much ſhame that I could not indure to go in the ſtreets, <hi>But that urgent nceſſity forc'd me to go out for comfort.</hi>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then it pleaſed God by ſpecial providence to caſt me under Dr. <hi>Homes</hi> his Miniſtry, and he treated on that ſubject concerning backſliding, out of <hi>Jer.</hi> 14 <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>O Lord, though our iniquities teſtify against us, yet do thou it for thy name ſake, for our back ſlidings are many, &amp;c.</hi> which Sermon was by the working of the Spirit of God effectual unto me, for I was almoſt under deſpair before, but the Lord was pleaſed to give me much comfort from this Doctrine <q>That Saints may be guilty of many backſlidings yet they ſhould not deſpair, for that was a grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſin. The Doctor made this Uſe, That if Saints might break their peace, wicked and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:153892:79"/> men might break their necks. A ſecond uſe was, that a Saint ſhould beware of backſliding, and make all ſpeed to go to Jeſus Chriſt for more ſtrength to keep and uphold him for the future This did give me ſome comfort, and cauſed me to ſet upon the work of ſeeking to Jeſus Chriſt more earneſtly, becauſe Chriſt told <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>his grace was ſufficient for him;</hi>
                  </q> I had reſted in that little <hi>muſtard-ſeed-faith</hi> I had before, but now it did begin to ſpring and bloſſom, to the praiſe and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Jeſus Chriſt, that he ſhould as it were ſnatch me as a Brand out of thoſe burnings of Hell, and eſtabliſh my poor ſoul by his free grace, to ſee all my iniquities laid to the charge of Chriſt, as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>All we like ſheep have gone aſtray, we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquities of us all.</hi> Which Scripture being opened by a worthy member of that Church Mr. F. it did much ſtrengthen my Faith in the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, when I came to conſider, <q>Firſt, That it was iniquity that the Lord Jehovah laid on Chriſt. Secondly, That it was my iniquity that was thus laid on him. Thirdly, that it was the Lord himſelf that did lay it on him. And Fourthly, That the Lord had done it already, it was not now to do. All theſe points did much comfort me, ſeeing they were back'd by Scripture, and ſuch a caution given by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 3.12. ſaying, <hi>Take heed leſt there be found in you an evil heart of unbelief, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Which is a great ſin and plague to any poor Soul, this wrought much with me but then applying ſeveral other Scriptures, to the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting praiſe of Jehovah, and to Jeſus Chriſt my Saviour, this ſcripture was produced in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.16. compared with the Apoſtles words, ſpeaking of Chriſt, <hi>Thou hast aſcended up on high, and led capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity captive, and received gifts for men, even rebellious

               <p>ABout twenty years ſince I being then with Child, was much troubled at ſome thoughts, which God put into my mind, touching my conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation; which lay ſo ſore and heavy upon me, that I could not tell what to do; Becauſe I ſaw, though I endeavoured as much as I could, to do my duty to
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:153892:80"/> my God. yet I was not able to live as I ſhould; and then I began to know what the worm of conſcience meant, I feeling what until then I was ignorant of: and the blackneſs of my ſpirit was ſuch, with the burden of my troubled and afflicted ſoul, that I could not at that time take comfort in any thing, and had I not been with child, &amp; affected with natural inclination to the Babe in my womb, I had been in danger (had not God prevented me) to have deſtroyed my ſelf, for I had ſome temptations that way; but my God ſtrengthened me: yet before I was brought to bed, I found peace and comfort, and through grace had ſuch ſettlement in my ſpirit, that I could with joy night and day call upon my God believingly: but before I attained to this, I had many ſore conflicts; until after ſome conſiderations that the Lord had put into my mind; as firſt, touching the child that I went with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe God hath ſaid, <hi>The juſt and inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent ſlay thou not;</hi> and then conſidering the innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the child, it became a means to ſtay my hand from laying violence upon my ſelf.</p>
               <p>Yet for a time I was much troubled in ſpirit, till God gave me peace from theſe, and other Scripture promiſes, where the Lord ſaith, <hi>Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will deliver thee, &amp; thou ſhalt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>XXXV.</hi> Experiences of <hi>F. P.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>I Have been troubled at the thoughts of my corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and wretched condition. I have formerly had ſome doubtings touchings the Scriptures, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they were truth or not, but have been ſince troubled, that I made thoſe fooliſh doubtings to queſtion Gods word, and was ſo wounded in my Conſcience for my ſin therein, that I feared I ſhould be damned for it. becauſe I thought it was a ſin that God would not pardon. I had alſo ſtrange thoughts about the ſinful wayes of ungodly people, and conſidering how looſely people live, I and temptations to perſwade me, that ſurely there was ſome eaſier way to Heaven then the Scriptures had laid down, or then I had learnt. But for theſe evil thoughts of mine, I have been ſo afflicted in my ſpirit that I thought I was a damned wretch. I have been tempted by theſe blaſphemous thoughts againſt the Lord, which have ſo afflicted me; that ſomtimes I feared the Devil would fetch me away, and carry me
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:153892:81"/> to Hell; and I have thought ſometimes, that ſurely God could not in juſtice pardon ſuch ſinnes as I have committed. I have alſo been tempted to make away my ſelf, but the Lord God put me in mind to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that it would not give me eaſe or comfort, but be the way to enter into endleſs miſeries.</p>
               <p>And thus I lay afflicted with a moſt ſad &amp; trouble ſome ſpirit for about a year, yet (though with little hope from my preſent ſence) I had deſires that God would ſave me, and ſome groanings I had after him. And in his time which is beſt, I began to find inlargement of heart from God, and a great long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for Chriſt, which encreaſed through the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his glorious power, ſo that (me thought) I could have been content to have gone through all the miſeries in the World to have enjoyed him. And in my ſleep I dreamed that I ſaw my Saviour lying in a Grave, and after again, I ſaw him riſen from death; when I awaked, and had ſome thoughts about my dream, I found comfort in my ſoul, and begun more ſweetly to hope, that Chriſt Jeſus dyed for my ſins, and is riſen again for my juſtification? but the Devil who goes about like a roaring Lyon did ſtill tempt me, ſo that I was again ready to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair for my former evil thoughts, and I was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid that Satan would have me; and I doubted that God had no part in me, which cauſed me to weep much, and I was exceedingly troubled, and ſometimes thought, that verily I heard the Devil coming in a Whirlwind for me, and ſo terrified was my conſcience that from the thoughts of the wrath which I feared, I could have wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my ſelf a Beaſt, a Dog, or any thing, becauſe their miſery would have an end.</p>
               <p>But after many comfortable diſcourſes with friends, and reading ſome godly books that came to my hands, the Lord God in time delivered me
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:153892:81"/> from thoſe temptations, and hath ſince com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted me with theſe Promiſes, to the great joy of my heart, though ſome times I have not been without ſome doubtings. The Lord hath ſaid, <hi>Be content with ſuch things as ye have,</hi> for he hath ſaid, <hi>I will never leave thee nor forſake thee, ſo that I may boldly ſay, the Lord is my helper,</hi> Heb. 13.5, 6. The Lord ſaith, <hi>ſin ſhall not have dominion over you,</hi> Rom. 6.14. This hath often given me much comfort, and kept up my ſoul when I have been ready to deſpair: And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I will pray the Father, and he ſhall give you another comforter, that he may abide with you for ever, even the Spirit of truth,</hi> John 14.16, 17.</p>
               <p>And I have this teſtimony of my intereſt in Chriſt, by faith wrought by his bleſſtd Spirit in me. 1 I ſee ſuch a frailty in my fleſh, that except the Lord ſend his holy Spirit to inable me, I cannot do any thing of my duty to God of my ſelf; it is the Spirit of the Lord, and not any thing in me, that is the foundation of my comfort. 2. I have had many times (if my heart deceive me not) clear teſtimonies and evidences that I love God more than any thing elſe, and deſire him above all. 3. I deſire much to hear the Word, and am troubled that ſometimes it doth not ſo pierce into my heart, as I deſire. 4. I have ſometimes ſuch ſweet comforts and enlargements in my ſoul, that I find much peace with God thereby, which I prize above all things in the world. 5. I deſire to ſerve the Lord in all things and am troubled when any thing obſtructs thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires. 6. I hope for ſalvation and true bleſſedneſs from Jeſus Chriſt my Redeemer, and from him alone. F. P.</p>

               </head>
               <p>I Have had great Conflicts of Soul for my ſins, and againſt ſin, and have ſhed many tears by night and by day; I have been much troubled at the conſideration of ſuch things, as have been at anytime a clog to hinder me from enjoying ſpiritual Communion with God, which I have deſired. It is the greateſt grief I have ever had, that I have offended ſo good a God; and indeed my ſins have been a very great trouble to me, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, in that God hath given me a meaſure of knowledge, and I have not walked up to it, to live according to the light I have received. But I have found comfort in God's Promiſes: Chriſt ſaith, <hi>All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me, and him that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> John chap. 6. verſe 37. <hi>Wherefore come out from among them, and be ye ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, ſaith the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a Father unto you, and ye ſhall be my Sons and Daughters, ſaith the Lord Almighty.</hi> The Lord will receive us if we repent and believe; and Chriſt calls, <hi>Come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt,</hi> Matth. 11.28. And as a teſtimony of my Regeneration, I have theſe Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, whereby to give account of the hope that is in me. 1. That all my deſires are chiefly to ſeek God in Chriſt. 2. I find much comfort in duties, to joyn in Ordinances, and to partake of the things of God. 3. I find my heart really at peace with all the World. 4. I believe that the Lord God is at peace with me, and will ſave me for ever through Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>D. C.</hi>

               <p>
                  <q>HAving met with the Experiences of this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious and worthy Gentlewoman in the account of her Life, publiſhed by her pious Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band Mr. <hi>Samual Clark,</hi> formerly Miniſter of St. <hi>Bennet Fink London,</hi> which were found writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in her own hand after her death; and they being ſo very pertinent to the others aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, I thought it might be very uſeful to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert them, without any alteration, in her own words.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When I was but young, my Father being at Prayer in his Family, I many times found ſuch ſweetneſs, and was ſo affected therewith, that I could not but wiſh that my heart might be oftner in ſuch a frame, but Childhood, and the Vanities thereof ſoon cooled theſe heavenly ſparks; but my Father (who was a Miniſter) cauſed we to write Sermons, and to repeat the ſame: As alſo to learn Mr. <hi>Perkins</hi> Catechiſm, which I oft repeated to my ſelf when I was alone; and therein I eſpecially took notice of thoſe places wherein he had ſet down the ſigns and marks of a ſtrong and weak Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing convinced in my Conſcience that without Faith I could not be ſaved; and that every Faith would not ſerve turn to bring me to Heaven. Hereupon I fell to examination of my ſelf, and though I could not find the marks of a ſtrong, yet through God's Mercy, I found the marks of a true, tho' but weak Faith, which was ſome comfort and ſupport to me. And that God which began this good work in me, was pleaſed to quicken and ſtir me up to a diligent uſe of ſuch means, as himſelf had ordained and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the encreaſe thereof, as hearing the Word, Preaching, private Duties, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But when I was about ſeventeen years old, my Parents ſent me to wait upon a young Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb facs="tcp:153892:83"/> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> the only Daughter of Sir <hi>W. W.</hi> At which time being ſent ſo far from my near and dear Relations, and meeting with ſome other diſcouragements in the Family, thro' want of the Means of Grace, which I formerly enjoyed, I grew very melancholy. I began alſo to have great workings of Conſcience in me, and Satan, the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Enemy to the health and welfare of our Souls, who, <hi>like a roaring Lion, walks about continually ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom he may devour,</hi> took this advantage, thro' my ignorance <hi>of his Devices,</hi> to raiſe up fears, doubts, and terrours of Conſcience in me, by reaſon of my manifold ſins, and for walking ſo unworthy of God's Mercies whilſt I did enjoy them, and for being ſo unfruitful under the Means of Grace, and ſo unable to obey God, and keep his Commandments. And by reaſon hereof, I had no peace nor reſt to my Soul night nor day, but was perſwaded that all the threatnings contained in the Book of God, againſt wicked and ungodly men, did belong to me, and were my portion, as being one of them againſt whom they were denounced. Inſomuch as when I took up the Bible to read therein, it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with much fear and trembling; yet being convinced that it was my duty frequently to read God's Word, I durſt not omit or neglect it. Thus I continued a great while, bearing the burden of grievous Temptations, and inward afflictions of Conſcience; yet durſt I not open the wound, nor reveal my condition to any, as thinking and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my caſe to be like no bodies elſe. But God, who is rich in mercy, and Jeſus Chriſt, who bought his people at ſo dear a rate, would not ſuffer any of his to be loſt, and therefore he was graciouſly pleaſed to preſerve, ſtrengthen and uphold me by his own power, from ſinking into Hell through de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, and from running out of my Wits. Thus by
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:153892:83"/> reaſon of my continual grief, and anguiſh of heart night and day, I was ſo weakened and changed within the compaſs of ſix months, that when I came home my dear Parents ſcarce knew me.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>For ſome years after her return, ſhe, for the moſt part, continued in her Fathers Family, where by a diligent and conſciencious uſe of the the Means, both publick and private, ſhe did thrive and grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, as ſhe increaſed in days and years; Till ſhe was married to Mr. <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Clark,</hi> to whom in all capacities ſhe was an excellent Wife; After her death in a little Book in her Cabinet, ſhe gave the former account of her Converſion to God, and added many more of her Experiences to this effect.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I here ſet down Gods graeious dealings with me, not for my own praiſe, but for the Glory of God, and to ſtir up my heart unto true thankfulneſs for ſuch unvaluable mercies. And I have had many expe<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>riences of Gods gracious dealings with me at ſeveral times under afflictions. 1. When Perſonal afflictions have lain upon me in reſpect of bodily ſickneſs, or Spiritual Diſtempers. 2. In family afflictions when God hath taken away my children. 3. When I have been under fears that God would take away my deaf huſband, by ſome dangerous ſickneſs which he lay under. 4. When I have been under great fears, in the time of our Civil Wars. 5. When I have been under Spiritual Deſertion, by Gods hiding his face and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from me; or by reaſon of weakneſs, and wants in grace: Or by reaſon of ſtrong and prevaling cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, or by reaſon of Satans temptations: In all theſe Caſes I have experienced Gods gracious Diſpenſations toward me; of which I ſhall ſet down a few.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed God for many years to keep me for the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:153892:84"/> moſt part in a ſad and deſolate Eſtate and condition not clearly evidencing the certain aſſurance of his love to my ſoul: So that many times I queſtioned whether I was a Child of God or no; whether I had part in Jeſus Chriſt or no: whether I ſhould ever at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to life and ſalvation or no: and this made me walk with a drooping and diſconſolate Spirit, ſo that I could have no ſure comfort in any thing: <hi>But tho' heavineſs endured for a night, yet joy came in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> when the Lord cauſed the light of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to ſhine upon me which was better than life.</p>
               <p>It pleaſed God upon the death of my youngeſt Child, that it lay very heavy upon my Spirit, in ſo much that I was brought oft upon my knees to beg ſupport from God, and to crave his grace and aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that I might not break out, to ſpeak or act any thing, whereby Gods name might be diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, or the Goſpel diſcredited: And that he would be pleaſed to make up this outward loſs, with ſome more durable and Spiritual good; and the Lord was pleaſed to return a gracious and ſpeedy anſwer to theſe my requeſts; for though I lay long under the burden of that loſs, yet the Lord in his due time did ſweetly manifeſt his ſpecial love to my ſoul, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring me that he was my gracious and reconciled Father in Chriſt; whereby my love to him was much increaſed, and even inflamed; ſo that by his grace, it wrought in me more diligence and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, to maintain and preſerve theſe Evidences of his love, and to yield a lively ſubmiſſion unto his will, as well in ſuffering as in doing: As alſo by avoiding whatſoever might provoke him, to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw the evidences of his love from me, without the ſenſe whereof I could take little or no comfort in any thing.</p>
               <p>And furthermore I bleſs God for it, and ſpeak it to the praiſe and glory of his rich and free grace,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:153892:84"/> my prayers and earneſt deſires have been anſwered, by God's giving me comfortable aſſurance, both from the teſtimony of his holy Word, and the witneſs of his bleſſed Spirit, of my eternal and everlaſting Salvation in and by Jeſus Chriſt. Yet have I not been without fears and doubtings many times, through want of looking over my Evidences, or by neglecting to keep a narrow watch over my heart; or from ſome weakneſs of my Faith, and all through my own default and negligence; the Lord pardon it, and make me more circumſpect for the time to come.</p>
               <p>By all theſe I have gained this Experience; 1. That God is true and faithful in making good all his promiſes ſeaſonably unto us: As that, <hi>All things ſhall work together for our good;</hi> and that God <hi>will never leave us nor forſake us,</hi> &amp;c. 2. That it is not in vain to wait upon God, and to ſeek unto him in our ſtraits, who is more ready to hear than we are to ask. 3. That I deſire to ſee, yea the Lord hath ſhewed me, the vanity and uncertainty of the moſt ſatisfying comforts that this World can afford, and what an emptineſs there is in them, that ſo I may, (and I deſire ſo to do) keep weaned affections toward them, and to ſit looſe from them, that I may be ready to part with them, when God calls them from me, or me from them.</p>
               <p>Again in regard of bodily weekneſs and ſickneſs, my Experiences have been theſe; 1. That as a broken ſhoulder can bear no burden; ſo the leaſt diſtemper, when the heart is not in a holy frame and temper, is a burden inſupportable. If God hides his face from us, and withdraws the evidences of his love, and denies to aſſiſt us by his ſtrength, we can neither do, nor ſuffer any thing. And on the contrary, I found by experience, that I could with much chearfulneſs, holy ſubmiſſion, and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:153892:85"/> willingneſs, bear great diſtempers, when I enjoyed the favour of God in them: So that then I could readily ſay, <hi>Good is</hi> the <hi>Work</hi> of the Lord, as well as his <hi>Word.</hi> And, <hi>I will bear the Indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him,</hi> Micah 7.9. And <hi>Job</hi> 13.15. <hi>Though he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> 2. I found by experience alſo, that by my pains and ſickneſs, I was the better able to ſympathize with, and to pity and pray for others in the like caſe. 3. Hereby I learn'd the more to prize health, and that upon ſeveral accounts, namely, becauſe in health we have liberty and opportunity to enjoy the Publick Ordinances with others of God's People, whereby the Graces of true Chriſtians are quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſtrengthened and increaſed in us, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, by reaſon of our corrupt Natures, are apt to grow cold and languiſh, as will our bodies if they want food. Again, becauſe in health we enjoy the benefit and the comfort of ſweet and quiet ſleep, which much refreſhes and cheers, and which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly we want in ſickneſs. Laſtly, Becauſe in health, we find ſweet, ſatisfying comfort in the uſe of God's good Creatures; whereas in ſickneſs, the daintieſt food is loathſom, and troubleſom. The conſideration of theſe things made me the more to prize health; to be very thankful for it, and the more careful to imploy and improve health and ſtrength to God's glory, and the furtherance of my own Salvation.</p>
               <p>In regard of publick dangers, I have had a great deal of experience of God's goodneſs toward me and mine ſeveral times. For when in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Civil Wars and Diſtractions 1642. I was ſometimes overwhelmed with weak and diſtruſtful fears, occaſioned by my not acting Faith upon the Promiſes, and not remembring my former Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, nor conſidering Gods love, power and
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:153892:85"/> fidelity to his Children, in performing his ſo many gracious promiſes, made unto them in all eſtates and conditions, and to me among the reſt: Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon I reſolved by God's grace and aſſiſtance, not to give way to this diſtruſt and diffidence, praying God to aſſiſt me therein, and found more courage than formerly, ſo far as I knew my own heart; though truly the heart is very deceitful, as I have found by ſad experience; the Lord teach me and inable me to rely upon him with more courage and conſtancy, and more to live by Faith upon his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes than formerly I have done. Indeed I have been apt to fall into new fears upon approaching dangers; yet upon ſucceſſes and glorious delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, I have oft reſolved, never to diſtruſt God again, and yet my naughty heart hath deceived me, and made me ready to faint; but this I found by experience, to the praiſe of my God's Free Grace, that as troubles have abounded, my conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations have abounded much more. For God brought ſeaſonably into my mind many precious promiſes, which were as ſo many ſweet Cordials, which much ſupported and comforted my heart, and upheld my ſpirit, when new ſtorms have ariſen, and unexpected deliverances have followed. And I have, and do reſolve, by God's Grace, not to diſtruſt him any more. Yer, though more and greater da<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>In regard of Satan's Temptations; eſpecially concerning my coming to the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, my Experiences have been theſe.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:153892:86"/> Finding often that I was very unable to fit and prepare my ſelf for a comfortable approach to that ſacred Ordinance, I uſed to deſire the prayers of the Congregation unto God in my behalf, and uſed the beſt endeavour I could in private, as God en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled me, though I came far ſhort of what was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and of what I deſired: So that I did truſt and hope, through God's mercy, to find a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable day of it, and to have it a ſealing Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance to my Soul: But on the contrary, I found much deadneſs, and little ſpiritual taſt, reliſh and comfort in the uſe of it; ſo that my ſpirit was oft much troubled, and caſt down in me, fearing leſt I had ſome ſecret ſin undiſcovered, and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of, which cauſed the Lord thus to hide his face from me. But then my gracious God brought this into my mind, that the Lord doth ſometimes afflict us for the exerciſe and improvement of our graces, as well as to humble us for our ſins. I alſo conſidered, that as the Lord doth tender great mercies to us in this Sacrament, renewing his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace, and ſealing to us the pardon of our ſins in the Blood of Chriſt; ſo he gives us leave to ingage our ſelves, by renewing our Covenant with him, to believe in him, and to truſt upon Chriſt for Life and Salvation: And it pleaſed God to give me Faith to apply this to my own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Soul; and a while after to ſhew me, and to make good to my Soul that precious and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able promiſe, That tho' <hi>he hides his face from us for a little moment, yet with mercy and loving kindneſs he will return to us again.</hi> This was a wonderful comfort and ſupport to my dejected heart: Bleſſed be the Lord for ever; I deſire to treaſure up theſe Experiences, that for the future, I may in the like caſe, reſolve to put my whole truſt and confidence in him, that ſo Satan may not intrap me in his
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:153892:86"/> ſnares through unbelief, but that I may <hi>reſiſt him, ſtedfaſt in the Faith.</hi> For I am not altogether <hi>igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of his devices.</hi> God's promiſe is, that <hi>in all theſe things we ſhall be more than Conquerors, through him that hath loved us:</hi> And hath ſaid, that, <hi>This is the Victory whereby we overcome the World, even our Faith,</hi> 1 John 5.4.</p>
               <p>In the year 1664. there came to us the ſad News of the death of my ſecond Son Mr. <hi>John Clark,</hi> a godly, faithful and powerful Miniſter. Thus as the waves of the Sea follow one another, ſo God is pleaſed to exerciſe his Children with one affliction after another; he ſees whilſt we carry about us this body of ſin, we have need of manifold Tryals and Temptations; as ſaith the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet,</hi> 1.6. <hi>Now for a ſeaſon ye are in heavineſs, if need be, through ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold temptations;</hi> to keep us under, and to make us the better to remember our ſelves. Indeed it hath been the Lord's courſe and dealing with me, ever ſince he ſtopped me in the way as I was poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Hell, to raiſe up one affliction or other, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inward or outward, either from Satan, the World, or my own corrupt heart, and nature; not having wiſdom and grace to behave and carry my ſelf as I ought under his various diſpenſations and providences, as appeared at this time by his laying ſo great and grievous an affliction upon me, in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away ſo dear a Son, from whom I had much Soul-comfort, and ardent affections, which he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted by his fervent prayers for me, and by his ſpiritual Letters, and Writings to me; wherein he applied himſelf ſuitably to my comfort, in thoſe inward troubles of heart and ſpirit that lay upon me. This cauſed my grief and ſorrows to take the greater hold on me, upon the loſs of one who was ſo uſeful to me: Yet hereby I do not derogate from my Elder Son, from whom I have the like
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:153892:87"/> help and comfort. Upon this ſad occaſion my grief grew ſo great, that I took no pleaſure of any thing in the World; but was ſo overwhelmed with me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy, and my natural ſtrength was ſo abated, that little food ſerved my turn, and I judged that I could not live long in ſuch a condition.</p>
               <p>Hereupon I began to examine my heart why it ſhould be ſo with me, and whether carnal, and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate affections, were not the great cauſe of my trouble, which I much feared. And having uſed many Arguments, and laid down many Reaſons to my ſelf, to quiet and moderate my paſſions, yet nothing prevailed to quiet and calm my heart, and to bow me to the obedience of Gods revealed Will: And withal conſidering that it was God only that could quiet the heart, and ſet our unruly and carnal affections into an holy frame and order, and that he was a preſent help in time of trouble; I often and earneſtly ſought the Lord, with many Prayers and Tears, beſeeching him to quiet my heart, and to over-power, and tame my unruly affections, ſo as to be willing to ſubmit unto him, and to bear his afflicting Hand patiently, and fruitfully, and to be ready and willing to ſubmit, either in doing or ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, whatſoever he pleaſed to impoſe upon me; and to be ready to part with the beſt cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward comfort I enjoyed, whenſoever he ſhould pleaſe to call for the ſame.</p>
               <p>And it pleaſed God ſeaſonably to hear my Prayer, to regard my Tears, and to grant my Requeſts, by calming and quieting my heart and ſpirit, and to give me much more contentedneſs to ſubmit to his holy Will, and good Pleaſure, who is a God of Judgment, and knows the fitteſt times and ſeaſons to come in with refreſhing comforts, and who waits to be gracious unto thoſe that truſt in him. Yet ſurely I was not without many temptations, in this
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:153892:87"/> hour of darkneſs, from that ſubtle Adverſary, who always ſtands at watch to inſinuate and frame his temptations, anſwerable to our conditions, and like <hi>a roaring Lion, walks about continually, ſeeking to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour</hi> poor, yet precious Souls. Then, <hi>I called upon the Lord in my diſtreſs, and he anſwered me, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered me. Bleſs the Lord, O my Soul! and all that is within me praiſe his holy Name. For he hath remembred me in my low</hi> and troubled <hi>eſtate, becauſe his mercy endureth for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus had new Experience of God's readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to hear and help, when I called upon him; and having found that it is not in vain to ſeek to, and to depend upon God in all our ſtraits, I could not but record theſe things, that ſo, <hi>Every one that is godly may ſeek unto him in a time where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he may be found, who is a preſent help in time of trouble, and who doth for us abundantly above what we can ask or think.</hi> The Lord knows that I write theſe things for no other end, but that God may have the glory, and that others, eſpecially my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, may be incouraged to ſeek God in their ſtraits, and to truſt in him at all times. If God ſhall pleaſe to bring me to my Grave in peace, let this be the Text at my Funeral, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>For by Grace ye are ſaved through Faith.</hi> This Scripture I was oft put upon, to have recourſe to in times of Temptation and Deſertion. Though our hearts may fail us, and our fleſh may fail us, yet the Lord will never fail us. <hi>Amen.</hi>

<pb n="150" facs="tcp:153892:88"/> name for irreligion and vice became a Proverb, and whoſe extraordinary repentance is a moſt re<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>markable example of the exceeding riches of the grace and mercy of God.</p>
               <p>His father was <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Wilmot</hi> who in the Civil Wars, adhered to <hi>K. Charles</hi> 1. and was very inſtrumental in the eſcape of <hi>K. Charles</hi> 2. after the Battel of <hi>Worceſter</hi> in 1651, but dying before the Reſtoration left his ſon little more then his Title of Earle of <hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and ſome pretenſions of the favour of <hi>Charles</hi> 2. after his return. This young Lord was educated in the Univerſity of <hi>Oxford,</hi> where his wit and Learning ſoon made him very eminent; But the general joy and debauchery that overran the Nation in 1660. had in a little time ſo great an influence upon him, that, he as well as a multirude of other Young Gentlemen ran into all manner of exceſs, to commit all kind of iniquity with greedineſs. And after his return from his Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels into <hi>Jtaly,</hi> having ſome perferment in the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical and debauch'd Court of <hi>K. Charles</hi> 2. he there met with incouragement &amp; countenance in proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the greateſt exceſſes &amp; extravagancies that were poſſibly to be acted, for as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays, <hi>whatſoever his eyes deſired he kept it not from them, and with held his heart from no joy;</hi> And to fortifie his conſcience againſt any convictions, he endeavoured to perſuade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelſ, that there was no <hi>Heaven</hi> nor <hi>Hell,</hi> no God nor <hi>Devil,</hi> nor any future State in another world; and yet becauſe at ſome intervals, he had ſevere reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in his mind, as to his vicious practices, he was forced to rid himſelf of them by a continued courſe of Intemperance, ſo that he acknowledged that for five years together he was continually drunk.</p>
               <p>And as his wickedneſs, ſo his wit and parts were extraordinary, ſo that had his fancy fallen upon Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Subjects, inſtead of thoſe impure and filthy ones
<pb facs="tcp:153892:88"/> wherein he uſually exerciſed his Poetry, he might probably, have been as uſeful in teaching vertue to this debauched generation, as his prophane Verſes have been miſcheivous and hurtful in promoting A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſm, vice, and lewdneſs. As to all outward accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of Learning and education, he was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in compleat, though by his ill management they were at length miſerable Comforts to him ſince they on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miniſtred to his ſins, and made his example the more fatal and dangerous, ſo that he owned himſelf to be one of the greateſt of ſinners; for his corrupted Parts made his impieties riſe to a high and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary pitch, as the chiefeſt of Angels for knowledge and Power became the moſt degenerate; ſo that his impious actions as well as Writings ſeem to ſoar a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the reach and thought of other men, taking as much pains to draw others in, and to pervert the ways of Virtue and Religion, as the Apoſtles and Primitive Saints did to <hi>ſave their own ſouls and thoſe that heard them:</hi> for this was the heightning and amazing circumſtance of his ſins, that he was ſo di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and induſtrious to recommend and propogate them; to declare his ſin as <hi>Sodom</hi> and not to hide it; framing Arguments for ſin, making Proſelytes to it; and writing Panygiricks upon Vice; ſinging praiſes to the Great Enemy of God, and caſting down Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets and Crowns before his Throne.</p>
               <p>This Character, his Chaplain who Preached his Funeral Sermon, gives of him; and adds, That he was ſo confirmed in ſin, that he lived, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times almoſt died a Martyr for it; God was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times pleaſed to puniſh him with the effects of his debaucheries, yet he confeſt, that for a long time it had no power to melt him into true Repentance; or if at any time he had ſome lucid intervals from his folly and madneſs, how ſhort and tranſitory were they? all that goodneſs was but as a morning

               <p>And yet even this deſperate Sinner, that ſeemed to have made a Covenant with death, and was at agreement with Hell, and juſt upon the brink of them both; God, to mganifie the riches of his Grace and Mercy, was pleaſed to ſnatch as a brand out of the fire. And, as the Apoſtle, <hi>though before a blaſphemer, a perſecutor, and injurious, yet obtained mercy, that in him Chriſt Jeſus might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering, for a pattern to them that ſhould after believe on him to eternal life,</hi> 1 Tim. 1.13, 16. So
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:153892:89"/> God ſtruck him to the ground as it were by a light from Heaven, and a voice of Thunder round about him; inſomuch that now the ſcales fall from his Eyes, as they did from the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi>'s, his ſtony heart was opened, and ſtreams of tears guſht out, the bitter, but wholſom rears of true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</p>
               <p>The means which prepared the way for this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful change, was a ſharp and painful ſickneſs with which he was viſited, which the Almighty often makes uſe of to reduce the wandring Sinner to the knowledge of God, and of himſelf. And though to forſake our ſins, then, when we can no longer commit them, ſeems to be rather neceſſity than choice; yet we often find that God uſes one to bring about the other, and improves a forced abſtinence from ſin into a ſettled loathing, and a true deteſtation of it. As in the caſe of <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> And of the Prodigal Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 20. And God ſaith of <hi>Ephraim, I will be unto</hi> Ephraim <hi>as a Lion; I will tear and go away, and none ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him, till they acknowledge their offence, and ſeek my face; and in their affliction they will ſeek me early, Hoſ.</hi> 5.14, 15. Though ſome ſtubborn Natures fly in the face of their heavenly Father while he is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting them; and others are like to thoſe Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, who, while under the Rod, promiſe won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and preſently forget all; As the Pſalmiſt ſays, <hi>When he ſlew them, then they ſought him, and they returned and enquired early after God, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they did but flatter him with their mouth, and lied unto him with their tongues, for their heart was not right with him, nor continued they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant,</hi> Pſal. 78.34, &amp;c. And probably this had been this Penitents Caſe formerly; but there was an evident difference bet<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ixt the effect of this laſt ſickneſs upon him, and many others before;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:153892:90"/> for he told the Miniſter, that he had now other ſentiments and thoughts of things, and acted upon quite different Principles; he was not vext that his ſickneſs was painful, or that it hindred him from his ſins, which he longed again to be at; but ſubmitted patiently to it, accepted it as the hand of God, and was thankful, bleſſing and praiſing God not only in his extremities, but for them alſo.</p>
               <p>And whereas formerly he had ſo habituated him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to curſing and ſwearing, that he uſed it almoſt every minute; there were now no curſings, no rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, nor reproaches to his Servants, or thoſe about him, which in other ſickneſſes were their uſual entertainments; but he treated them with all the meekneſs and patience in the World, begging pardons frequently of the meaneſt of his Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dants but for an haſty word, which the extremity of his ſickneſs, and ſharpneſs of his diſeaſe (pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from an Ulcer in his Bladder, which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Urine to paſs from him with intolerable pain) might eaſily force from him. Of which one inſtance is related, that calling for ſomething which he thought was not brought him ſoon enough, he cryed, <hi>that damned Fellow,</hi> but being gently ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſht, inſtantly recollected himſelf, complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of that Language of Hell or Feinds, which he ſaid had been formerly ſo familiar to him, that it ſtill hung about him, whereas none deſerved to be damned more than he had done; and deſired to ask his Servants pardon for that raſh ſaying.</p>
               <p>His Prayers were not now ſo much for eaſe, or health, or a continuance of his life, as for grace and faith, and perfect reſignation to the will of God; ſo that it may be charitably and juſtly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that his ſickneſs was not the chief ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:153892:90"/> but through the grace of God, an effectual means of true, tho' late Repentance: For tho' it was a Death-bed Repentance, and therefore full of danger, and the utmoſt hazard, yet it was not wholly impoſſible to be true, nor abſolutely deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate; ſince that God, who is a God of infinite compaſſion and forbearance, allowed him leiſure and opportunity for Repentance by a long and lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring ſickneſs; That he awaken'd him out of his ſpiritual ſlumber by a pungent diſtemper, as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide prudently for his worldly affairs, and yet not to be diſtracted nor diverted by them from the thoughts of a better World; that God lengthened out his day of grace, and accompanied the ordinary means of Salvation, and the weak Miniſtry of his Word, with the convincing and over-ruling power of his Spirit to his Conſcience, which Word of God became to him quick and powerful, ſharper than any two-edged Sword, piercing even to the dividing aſunder of his Soul and Spirit: And at laſt the Spirit of God witneſſed to his Spirit, that now he was become one of the Children of God.</p>
               <p>Upon my firſt Viſit to him (ſaith the Miniſter) at his return from a Journey out of the Weſt, he moſt gladly received me, ſhewed me extraordinary reſpects upon the ſcore of my Office, and thanked God, who had in mercy and good providence ſent me to him, who ſo much needed my prayers and counſels, acknowledging how unworthily heretofore he had treated Miniſters of the Goſpel, reproaching them that they were proud, and propheſied only for reward; but now he had learnt how to value them, that he eſteemed them the Servants of the moſt High God, who were to ſhew to him the way to Everlaſting Life. At the ſame time I found him labouring under ſtrange trouble and conflicts of mind, his Spirit wounded, and his Conſcience full
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:153892:91"/> of terrour. Upon rhis Journey he told me, he had been arguing with greater vigour againſt God and Religion than ever he had done in his life-time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and that he was reſolved to run them down with all the arguments and ſpite in the World. But, like the great Convert St. <hi>Paul,</hi> he found it hard to kick againſt the pricks. For God at that time had ſo ſtruck his heart by his immediate hand, that preſently he argued as ſtrongly for God and Virtue as before he had done againſt it. He declared, that God ſtrangely opened his heart, creating in his mind moſt awful, and tremendous thoughts and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the Divine Majeſty, with a delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful contemplation of the Divine Nature and Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, and of the lovelineſs of Religion and Virtue; <q>I never, ſaid he, was advanced thus far toward happineſs in my life before; for tho' upon the commiſſions of ſome ſins extraordinary, I have had ſome checks and warnings conſiderable from within, yet I ſtill ſtruggled with 'em, and ſo wore them off again. The moſt obſervable I remember, ſaid he, was this: One day at an Atheiſtical Meeting at a Perſon of Qualities, I undertook to manage the Cauſe, and was the principal Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant againſt God and Piety, and for my perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mances received the applauſe of the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany: Upon which my mind was terribly ſtruck, and I immediately replied thus to my ſelf: Good God! that a man that walks upright, that ſees the wonderful works of God, and has the uſes of his ſenſe and reaſon, ſhould uſe them to the defying of his Creator! But tho' this was a good beginning towards my Converſion, to find my Conſcience touched for my ſins, yet it went off again; yet all my life long I had a ſecret value and reverence for an honeſt man, and lov'd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in others; but I had formed an odd Scheme
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:153892:91"/> of Religion to my ſelf, which would ſolve all that God or Conſcience might force upon me; yet I was not ever well reconciled to the buſineſs of Religion, nor had that reverence for the Goſpel as I ought to have.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This Eſtate of mind continued till the 53. chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> was read to him wherein there is a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcription of the ſufferings of our ſaviour, and the benefits thereof and ſome other portions of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: by the power and efficacy of which word, aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his holy ſpirit, God ſo wrought upon his heart that he declared, that the myſteries of the Paſſion appeared ſo clear and plain to him as ever any thing did that was repreſented in a glaſs; ſo that the joy and admiration which poſſeſſed his ſoul upon the reading of Gods word to him was remarkable to all about him, and he had ſo much delight in his Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, that he begged his mother and Lady to read the ſame to him frequently, and was unſatisfied not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his great pains and weakneſs, till he had learned eſpecialy, the 53. chapter of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> with out book, comparing this prophecy with the Paſſion of Chriſt in the Evangeliſts, and obſerving that it was clearly foretold by the Prophet ſome hundred of years before it was accompliſhed; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration had ſuch mighty influence upon his ſoul, and ſtrengthned his faith, that afterward he never had the leaſt doubt about the certainty of the Goſpel and eternal ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt; He ſaid the in the firſt verſe of that chapter the prophet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared what great oppoſition the Doctrine of Chriſt Crucified would meet with in the world from ſuch obſtinate ſinners as he was, <hi>who hath believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed.</hi> And that the lowlineſs of his condition and perſon upon earth would cauſe weak, and inconſidering men to undervalue him, becauſe he did not appear with the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:153892:92"/> vain ſplendor &amp; pomp wherin they were pleaſed. This he ſaid was plainly predicted in the ſecond verſe. <hi>He hath no form or comlineſs; and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty, that we ſhould deſire him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>At the ſame time diſcourſing of the manner of his youth up, which all men knew was too too much devoted to the ſervice of ſin, and that the luſts of the fleſh, of the eye, and the pride of life had cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated him: <q>He was very large and particular in his acknowledgments about it, and more ready to accuſe himſelf than any other could be, Publickly crying out O Bleſſe God, can ſuch an horrid creature as I am be accepted by thee, who has denied thy Being and contemned thy Power? can there be Pardon and mercy for me? will God own ſuch a wretch as I am? ſhall the unſpeakable joys of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven be conferred upon me? O Mighty Saviour! never but through thine infinite love and ſatisfact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion! O never, but by the purchaſe of thy blood! Adding that with all abhorrency he did reflect up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his former courſe of life; that ſincerely and from his heart he did repent of all that folly and madneſs which he had committed.</q> He had a true and lively ſenſe of God's great mercy to him in ſtrike<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his hard heart, and laying his conſcience open, which hitherto had been deaf to all God's calls and methods, ſaying <q>If that God who dyed for Great as well as Leſſer ſinners, did not ſpeedily apply his infinite merits to his poor ſoul, his wound was ſuch as no man could conceive or bear, Crying out, that he was the vileſt wretch and Dog that the ſun ſhined upon, or the earth bore; that now he ſaw his error in not living up to that Reaſon which God had endued him with, and which he had unworthily vilified and centemned; wiſhing that he had been a ſtarving Leper, crawling in a ditch, that he had been a link boy, or a beggar,
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:153892:92"/> or for his whole lifetime confined to a Dungeon, rather than thus to have ſinned againſt his God.</q>
               </p>
               <p>His faith was remarkable, in an hearty embrace<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing and pious Confeſſion of all the Articles of the Chriſtian Religion, and all the Divine myſteries of the Goſpel, ſaying; that the abſurd and fooliſh Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy <q>which the world ſo much admired, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogated by the late Mr. <hi>Hobs,</hi> and others, had undone him, and many more, of the beſt Parts in the nation;</q> who without Gods great mercy, may never, it may be, attain to ſuch a ſerious repentance as his was, He faithfully adhered to, and caſt himſelf entirely upon the mercies of Jeſus Chriſt, and the free grace of God declared to repenting ſinners thro' him, with a thankful remembrance of his life, Death and reſurrection; begging of God to ſtrengthen his faith, and often crying out <hi>Lord I believe help thou mine unbelief.</hi> He had a mighty love for and eſteem of the holy Scriptures, which he had formerly too much ſlighted and ridicul'd; taking up reſolutions to read them frequently, and meditate upon them if God ſhould ſpare him, having already taſted the good word; for having ſpoken to his heart, he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged all the <q>ſeeming abſurdities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions thereof, fancied by men of corrupt and reprobate judgments were vaniſhed and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies and beauty appeared, being come to receive the truth in the love of it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He was extraordinary fervent and frequent in his prayers and ſupplications, and often called upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to pray for and with him, or to read the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to him: and toward the end of his ſickneſs would heartily deſire God to pardon his infirmities if he ſhould not be ſo wakeful &amp; Intent thro' the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as he wiſhed to be; and that tho' the fleſh was weak, yet the Spirit was willing, and hoped God
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:153892:93"/> would accept that. He continually beſeeched God by his grace and Holy Spirit to ſuſtain him and to keep him from all evil thoughts, from all temptations and Diabolical ſuggeſtions, and every thing that might be prejudicial to rhat religious temper of mind which God had now ſo happily endued him withal: Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out one night eſpecially <q>how terribly the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter did aſſault him by caſting upon him, leud and wicked imaginations, but I thank God ſaid he, I abhor them all, and by the power of his grace which I am ſure is ſufficient for me, I have over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come them; t'is the malice of the Devil becauſe I am reſcued from him: and the goodneſs of God that frees me from all my ſpiritual enemies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He was very joyful at his Lady's converſion from Popery, being as he termed it, a faction ſupported only by fraud and cruelty; which was done by her with deliberation and mature judgment. <q>He was heartily concerned for the pious education of his Children, wiſhing that his ſon might never be a wit; that is, ſaid he that he might never be one of thoſe wretched Creatures who pride themſelves in abuſing God and Religion, denying his being or his ptovidence; but that he might become an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, and a religious man, which could only be the ſupport and bleſſing of his family; complaining what a vicious and naughty world his children were brought into, and that no fortunes or honours were comparable to the love and ſavour of God to them, in whoſe name he bleſſed them, prayed for them and committed them to his Protection.</q> He had one ſon and three daughters and once calling them all before him, he ſaid to a Gentleman then preſent, that he might there obſerve how good the Almighty had been to him, in beſtowing ſo many bleſſings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, but that he had carried himſelf to God lik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="161" facs="tcp:153892:93"/>
               <p>He gave ſtrict charge to thoſe Perſons in whoſe cuſtody his papers were, to burn all his prophane and leud writings, as being only fit to promote vice and immorality, by which he had ſo highly offended God, and ſhamed and blaſphemed that holy Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion into which he had been baptized; and all his obſcene and filthy pictures which were ſo notoriouſly ſcandalous. He ſhewed much readineſs to make reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution to the utmoſt of his power to all perſons whom he had injured, and for thoſe whom he could not make compenſation to, he prayed for God's, and there pardons. And he was remarkably juſt in taking all poſible care for the payment of his debts, which before he confeſſed he had not ſo fairly and effectualy done. He was exceeding ready to forgive all injuries done againſt him, ſome of which he particularly mentioned, which were great and provoking, yet he was willing not only to pardon them, but likewiſe to give them aſſurance of his future friendſhip; and hoping that he ſhould be as freely forgiven at the hand of God. He was very tender and concerned for his ſervants who were about him in his extremities, (to whom he was very kind by his laſt Will) pitying there trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in watching with him, and attending him, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them with candor and gentleneſs as if they had been his Equals.</p>
               <p>He heartily endeavoured to be ſerviceble to thoſe about him, exhorting them to the fear and love of God, and to make good uſe of his forbearance and long ſuffering to ſinners, which ſhould lead them to repentance. And particularly a Perſon of Quality coming to viſit him on his death bed, he addreſſed him with this moſt pious and moſt paſſionate excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. <q>O Remember that you contemn God no more, He is an avenging God and will viſit you for your ſins; and will in mercy I hope touch

He gave it another learned Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine in charge, not to ſpare him (if he ſhould dye) in publiſhing any thing which might be of uſe to the Living, being willing that the worſt as well as the beſt part of his life ſhould be expoſed;</q> ſo ſincere was he in his repentance, as to be willing to take ſhame to himſelf, by ſuffering his faults to be expoſed for the benefit of others: Praying God that as his life had done much hurt, ſo his death might do ſome good.</p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:153892:94"/>
               <p>Laſtly, He diſcovered a great willingneſs to dye, if it pleaſed God; reſigning himſelf always to the Divine diſpoſal; but if God ſhould ſpare him yet a longer time here, he hoped to bring glory to the Name of God in the whole courſe of his life, and particularly by his endeavours to convince others; and to aſſure them of the danger of their condition if they continued impenitent, and how graciouſly God had dealt with him; being deſirous to live upon no other account, but that by the change of his manners, and his former company, and courſe of life, he might in ſome meaſure take off the high ſcandal that his former behaviour had given. He had a great ſenſe of his Obligations to thoſe worthy Divines who charitably and frequently viſited him, and prayed with him, and were thereby all very ſerviceable to his Repentance. <hi>I</hi> ſhall conclude theſe Remarks with his Dying Remonſtrance ſigned by his own hand, as his trueſt ſenſe, which is as follows.</p>

               <p>He enjoyed a ſteddy temper of mind through the whole courſe of his ſickneſs and repentance, which muſt needs proceed not from a hurry or perturbation of mind or body ariſing from the fear of death, or dread of Hell only, but from an ingenious love to God, and an uniform regard to virtue, ſuitable to that ſolemn Declaration of his; <hi>I would not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the leaſt ſin to gain a kingdom;</hi> And he had all poſſible ſymptoms of a laſting perſeverance in this admirable Chriſtian Reſolution, if God had reſtored him to health. To which may be added his comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table perſuaſions of God's accepting him to his mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſaying three or four days before his death; I ſhall dye, but Oh what unſpeakable Glories do I ſee! what ioys beyond thought or expreſſion am I ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of! I am aſſured of God's mercy to me through Jeſus Chriſt. Oh how I long to dye, and to be with my Saviour.</p>
               <p>The time of his ſickneſs and repentance was juſt nine weeks, in all which ſpace he was ſo much maſter of his reaſon, and had ſo clear an underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, except about thirty hours in which he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirous,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:153892:95"/> that he never dictated or ſpoke more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in his life. And therefore if any ſhall conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to ſay, his Piety was the effect of madneſs or vapours, the aſſertion is as ſilly as it is wicked; And that the force of this great penitence may not be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by evil men, who are reſolved to harden their hearts againſt all convictions, by ſaying it was done in a corner; the truth hereof is very well known to all ſorts of perſons, who in conſiderable numbers viſited and attended him, and particularly by thoſe eminent Phiſitians who were converſant with him in the whole courſe of his tedious ſickneſs, and who if any, were competent judges whether he were in a phrenſie or diſtracted, who all declared that he had not the leaſt Symptoms of it, but was as ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as at any time in his life and health. And if any ſhall be ſtill unſatiſfied herein, in this hard hearted generation, it matters not, let them at their coſt be Unbelievers ſtill, ſo long as this excellent penitent en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>joys the comfort of his repentance; ſince from all theſe admirable ſigns we have great reaſon to believe comfortably that his repentance was real and his end happy; and we may accordingly imitate the neighbours and Coſens of Elizabeth <hi>Luke</hi> 1.58. who when they heard how the Lord had ſhewed great <hi>mercy upon her, came and rejoyced with her,</hi> and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we ſhall joyn with the whole Court of Heaven, ſince our Bleſſed Saviour has told us. <hi>Luke.</hi> 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>7. <hi>I ſay unto you, that joy ſhall he in heaven over one ſinner that repenteth more then over ninety and nine Perſons that need no repentance.</hi> He dyed without convulſion or groan at Woodſtock Park in Oxfordſhire July. 26. 1680.</p>

            <p>AN account of the duty and uſefulneſs of commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating Experiences is already given; I ſhall on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly add, that if any ſhould take offence at the publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe Experiences, and judge it unmeet, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially becauſe ill men may make a bad uſe of them, I deſire ſuch to conſider that wicked Perſons will take all opportunities to ſcandalize Religion, though no occaſion be given; and they will likewiſe abuſe the beſt of things to evil purpoſes; Yet the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſays, <hi>Come and hear all ye that fear the Lord, and I will declare what he hath done for my Soul. Reſtore unto me the joy of my ſalvaton, then will I teach tranſgreſſors thy ways, amd ſinners ſhall be converted unto thee,</hi> Pſ. 51. So that this declaring of Experiences is one means which we may expect the Lord will make ſucceſsful to the Converſion of ſinners. And indeed the Book of Pſalms is preſented to the eyes of all men both good and bad, and doth conſiſt for the moſt part of Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences. And <hi>Paul</hi> declareth the manner of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to thoſe that perſecuted him; and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> bids us be ready alwayes to give an anſwer to every man that asketh a reaſon of the hope that is in us, with meekneſs and fear. There are ſeveral other uſes and advantages from declaring Experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which are mentioned in the beginning, to which the Reader is referred. I ſhall conclude all with repeating my earneſt deſires, that this ſmall tract may be of ſome profit to the ſouls of men, and then my deſign in publiſhing it will be anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>W.
